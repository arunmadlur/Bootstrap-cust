Valuation is used by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/introduction-to-financial-markets-and-products-rrt3co39vd214-video\">financial market<\/a> participants to determine the price they are willing to pay or receive to perfect the&nbsp;sale of a business. In addition to estimating the selling price of a business, the same valuation tools are often used by business appraisers to resolve disputes related to estate and gift taxation, divorce litigation, allocate business purchase price among business assets, establish a formula for estimating the value of partners&#39; ownership interest for buy-sell agreements, and many other business and legal purposes.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The field of business valuation encompasses a wide array of fields and methods. The tools and methods can vary between valuators, businesses and industries. Common approaches to business&nbsp;valuation include review of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/financial-statement-analysis-rar25-article\" title=\"financial statements\">financial statements<\/a>, discounting cash flow models, and similar company comparisons.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How to Value a Business?: <\/strong>How much your business is worth depends on many factors, from the current state of the economy through your business&rsquo;s balance sheet. Let me say it up front,&nbsp;I do not believe that business owners should do their own business valuation. This is a lot like asking a mother how talented her child is. Neither the business owner nor the mother has the necessary distance to step back and answer the question objectively. So to ensure that you set and get the best price when you&#39;re selling a business, I recommend getting a business valuation done by a professional.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Different methods of corporate valuation (market relative valuation)<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/resources\/finance-management-articles\" title=\"Asset-based approaches\">Asset-based approaches<\/a><\/strong>: Basically these business valuation methods total up all the investments in the business. Asset-based business valuations can be done on a going concern or on a liquidation basis.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>A <strong>going concern asset-based approach<\/strong> lists the business net balance sheet value of its assets and subtracts the value of its liabilities.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>A <strong>liquidation asset-based approach<\/strong> determines the net cash that would be received if all assets were sold and liabilities paid off.<\/li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Earning value approaches<\/strong>: These business valuation methods are predicated on the idea that a business&#39;s true value lies in its ability to produce wealth in the future. The most common earning value approach is Capitalizing Past Earning. With this approach, a valuator determines an expected level of cash flow for the company using a company&#39;s record of past earnings, normalizes them for unusual revenue or expenses, and multiplies the expected normalized cash flows by a capitalization factor. The capitalization factor is a reflection of the&nbsp;rate of return a reasonable purchaser would expect on the investment, as well as a measure of the risk that the expected earnings will not be achieved.<\/li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Discounted Future Earnings<\/strong> is another earning value approach to business valuation where instead of an average of past earnings, an average of the trend of predicted future earnings is used and divided by the capitalization factor.<\/li>\r\n\t<li><strong>What might such capitalization rates be? : <\/strong>It is quite subjective. Well established businesses with a history of strong earnings and good market share might often trade with a capitalization rate of, say 12% to 20%. Unproven businesses in a fluctuating and volatile market tend to trade at much higher capitalization rates, say 25% to 50%.<\/li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Market value approaches<\/strong><strong>:<\/strong> Market value approaches to business valuation attempt to establish the value of your business by comparing your business to similar businesses that have recently sold. Obviously, this method is only going to work well if there are a sufficient number of similar businesses to compare.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Although the Earning Value Approach is the most popular business valuation method, for most businesses, some combination of business valuation methods will be the most fair&nbsp;way to set a selling price.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Valuation of closely held company\/Minority ownership (Small business valuation):<\/strong> In valuing a minority and&nbsp;non-controlling interest in a business, however, the valuation professional must consider the applicability of discounts that affect such interests.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Discount for lack of control: The first discount that must be considered is the discount for lack of control, which in this instance is also a minority interest discount. Minority interest discounts are the inverse of control premiums<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Discount for lack of marketability: Another factor to be considered in valuing closely held companies is the marketability of an interest in such businesses. Marketability is defined as the ability to convert the business interest into cash quickly, with minimum transaction and administrative costs, and with a high degree of certainty as to the amount of net proceeds. There is usually a cost and a time lag associated with locating interested and capable buyers of interests in privately held companies, because there is no established market of readily available buyers and sellers. All other factors being equal, an interest in a publicly traded company is worth more because it is readily marketable. Conversely, an interest in a private-held company is worth less because no established market exists.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>","h1Tag":"Using Business Valuation in Valuating Your Business","url":"resources\/finance-management-articles\/business-valuation-rar8","status":"1","image_url":"http:\/\/cfs22.simplicdn.net\/ice9\/free_resources_article_thumb\/1-business_valuation.jpg","created_at":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","updated_at":"2015-12-10 13:02:27","infographic_url":null,"thumbnail_url":"NULL","shares":0,"likes":0,"comments":0,"engagement_score":0,"segments":[],"skills":[],"tags":[],"id":"56dfb0f1ac530efd098b4568"},{"course_id":[],"type":"article","label_id":"5","vertical":null,"name":"Instilling Corporate Finance Practices in Organizations","display_name":"Instilling Corporate Finance Practices in Organizations","author_name":"Eshna","author_description":"Eshna is a writer at Simplilearn.

Cash flows after the forecast period can only be represented by a fixed number such as annual growth rates. There are no fixed rules for determining the duration of the forecast period.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Example: &lsquo;ABC&rsquo; is a medical ICT startup that has just finished their business plan. Their goal is to provide medical professionals with software solutions for doing their own bookkeeping. Their only investor is required to wait for five years before making an exit. Therefore ABC is using a forecast period of five years.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Determine the yearly Cash Flow: Cash flow is the difference between the amount of cash flowing in and out a company. Make sure to consistently include the different types of cash flows.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Example: ABC has chosen to use only operational cash flows in determining their estimated yearly cash flow: In thousand &euro;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/cfs22.simplicdn.net\/ice9\/general\/dcf_2.png\" style=\"width: 603px; height: 103px;\" \/><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Determine Discount Factor \/ Rate: Determine the appropriate discount rate and discount factor for each year of the forecast period based on the risk level associated with the company and its market.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Example: ABC has chosen their discount rates based upon their company maturity.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/cfs22.simplicdn.net\/ice9\/general\/dcf_3.png\" style=\"width: 639px; height: 108px;\" \/><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Determine Current Value: Calculate the current value of the future cash flows by multiplying each yearly cash flow by the discount factor for the year in question. This is known as the time value of money.<br \/>\r\n&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/cfs22.simplicdn.net\/ice9\/general\/dcf_4.png\" style=\"width: 639px; height: 154px;\" \/>Determine the Continuing Value\/Terminal value: Calculating cash flows after the forecast period is much more difficult as uncertainty, and therefore the risk factor rises with each additional year into the future. The continuing value, or terminal value, is a solution that represents the cash flows after the forecast period.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Example: ABC has chosen the perpetuity growth model to calculate the value of cash flows after the forecast period. They estimate that they will grow at about 6% for the rest of these years.<br \/>\r\n(182*1.06 \/ (0.25-0.06)) = 1015.34 This value however is a future value that still needs to be discounted to a current value: 1015.34 * 1\/ (1.25) ^5 = 332.72<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Determining Equity Value: The value of the equity can be calculated by subtracting any outstanding debts from the total of all discounted cash flows.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Example<\/strong>: ABC doesn&rsquo;t have any debt so it only needs to add up the current value of the continuing value and the current value of all cash flows during the forecast period:<br \/>\r\n62.14 + 332.72= 394.86. The equity value of ABC: &euro; 394.86<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Advantage of Discounted cash flow analysis:<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>The DCF method is forward-looking and depends more on future expectations rather than historical results.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>The DCF analysis is focused on cash flow generation and is less affected by accounting practices and assumptions.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Shortcomings of DCF:<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>The accuracy of the valuation determined using the DCF method is highly dependent on the quality of the assumptions regarding FCF, TV, and discount rate. As a result, DCF valuations are usually expressed as a range of values rather than a single value by using a range of values for key inputs. It is also common to run the DCF analysis for different scenarios, such as a base case, an optimistic case, and a pessimistic case to gauge the sensitivity of the valuation to various operating assumptions. While the inputs come from a variety of sources, they must be viewed objectively in the aggregate before finalizing the DCF valuation.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>The Continuing value often represents a large percentage of the total DCF valuation. Valuation, in such cases, is largely dependent on continuing value assumptions rather than operating assumptions for the business or the asset.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Conclusion<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Discounted Cash Flow model is merely a mechanical valuation tool, which makes it subject to the axiom &quot;garbage in, garbage out&quot;. Small changes in inputs can result in large changes in the value of a company. Instead of trying to project the cash flows to infinity, terminal value techniques are often used. A simple annuity is used to estimate the terminal value past 10 years, for example.

Quality, time, and cost are the most common divisions to be measured. Improvements from learning by benchmarking can result in running a business more efficiently and much more cost effectively.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Benchmarking is most often used in order to evaluate performance by focusing on one or more particular indicators. This could be cost per unit, productivity, defects per unit, or otherwise. This measurement of performance is then compared to other firms within their industry. Benchmarking is a process that is often utilized by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/resources\/sap-certification-articles\/strategic-enterprise-management-and-its-components-rar101\">strategic management<\/a>. Organizations evaluate the various aspects of their processes and compare them to the processes of &ldquo;best practice&rdquo; companies. Most often these &ldquo;best practice&rdquo; companies are from within the same field or industry.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The information gained from such a comparison allows firms to determine how well they perform in comparison with the &ldquo;best&rdquo; and, in turn, develop new and better plans on how to make improvements or adopt certain best practices. Benchmarking is most commonly an on-going process in which firms continuously seek the improvement of their practices.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Various types of benchmarking:<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>Performance Benchmarking:<\/strong> allows the initiator firm to assess their competitive position by comparing products and services with those of target firms.<\/li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Collaborative Benchmarking: A type of benchmarking <\/strong>carried out collaboratively by groups of companies (e.g. subsidiaries of a multinational in different countries, Ex: Collaborative benchmarking in health care a collaborative approach to traditional benchmarking involves the formation of a voluntary network of health care providers that cooperate in carrying out the benchmarking study)<\/li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Technical\/Product Benchmarking:<\/strong> the process of designing new products or upgrades to current ones. This process can sometimes involve reverse engineering which is taking apart competitors&rsquo; products to find strengths and weaknesses.<\/li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Process Benchmarking:<\/strong> the initiating firm focuses its observation and investigation of business processes with a goal of identifying and observing the best practices from one or more benchmark firms. Activity analysis will be required where the objective is to benchmark cost and efficiency; increasingly applied to back-office processes where outsourcing may be a consideration.<\/li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Strategic Benchmarking:<\/strong> involves observing how others compete. This type is usually not industry specific, meaning it is best to look at other industries.<\/li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Investor benchmarking:<\/strong> extending the benchmarking universe to also compare peer companies that can be considered alternative investment opportunities from the perspective of an investor.<\/li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Functional Benchmarking:<\/strong> a company will focus its benchmarking on a single function to improve the operation of that particular function. Complex functions such as Human Resources, Finance and Accounting and Information and Communication Technology are unlikely to be directly comparable in cost and efficiency terms and may need to be disaggregated into processes to make valid comparison.<\/li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Operational Benchmarking:<\/strong> embraces everything from staffing and productivity to office flow and analysis of procedures performed<\/li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Metric Benchmarking: <\/strong>Another approach to making comparisons involves using more aggregative cost or production information to identify strong and weak performing units. The two most common forms of quantitative analysis used in metric benchmarking are data envelope analysis (DEA) and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/resources\/finance-management-videos\/regression-with-a-single-regressor-hypothesis-tests-and-confidence-intervals-rrt3co39vd206\">regression <\/a>analysis. DEA estimates the cost level an efficient firm should be able to achieve in a particular market. In infrastructure regulation, DEA can be used to reward companies\/operators whose costs are near the efficient frontier with additional profits. Regression analysis estimates what the average firm should be able to achieve. With regression analysis, firms that performed better than average can be rewarded while firms that performed worse than average can be penalized. Such benchmarking studies are used to create yardstick comparisons, allowing outsiders to evaluate the performance of operators in an industry. Advanced statistical techniques, including stochastic frontier analysis, have been used to identify high and weak performers in industries, including applications to schools, hospitals, water utilities, and electric utilities.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the biggest challenges for metric benchmarking is the variety of metric definitions used among companies or divisions. Definitions may change over time within the same organization due to changes in leadership and priorities. The most useful comparisons can be made when metrics definitions are common between compared units and do not change so improvements can be verified.<br \/>\r\n&nbsp;<\/p>","h1Tag":"Financial Benchmarking to Assess Enterprise Productivity","url":"resources\/finance-management-articles\/financial-benchmarking-rar13","status":null,"image_url":"http:\/\/cfs22.simplicdn.net\/ice9\/free_resources_article_thumb\/freeresources_517e3849dc394.jpg","created_at":"2016-03-09T05:13:21+00:00","updated_at":null,"infographic_url":null,"thumbnail_url":"NULL","shares":0,"likes":0,"comments":0,"engagement_score":0,"segments":[],"skills":[],"tags":[],"id":"56dfb0f1ac530efd098b456d"},{"course_id":["284","148","38","309","310"],"type":"article","label_id":"5","vertical":"business","name":"Significance of Financial Instruments in Capital Management","display_name":"Significance of Financial Instruments in Capital Management","author_name":null,"author_description":null,"author_image":null,"author_linkedin_profile":null,"author_twitter_profile":null,"short_description":null,"article_content":"<h3><strong><u>Types of Financial Instruments<\/u><\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Financial Instruments<\/strong> are intangible assets, which are expected to provide future benefits in the form of a claim to future cash.

A futures contract is a legally binding commitment to buy or sell a standard quantity at a price determined in the present (the futures price) on a specified future date.<\/li>\r\n\t<li><em><u>Swaps<\/u><\/em>: A swap is an agreement whereby two parties (called counterparties) agree to exchange periodic payments. The cash amount of the payments exchanged is based on some predetermined principal amount.<\/li>\r\n\t<li><em><u>Options<\/u><\/em>: An option is a contract in which the option seller grants the option buyer the right to enter into a transaction with the seller to either buy or sell an underlying asset at a specified price on or before a specified date.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong><u>Financial Markets:<\/u><\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>A <strong>financial market<\/strong> is a market where financial instruments are exchanged or traded.

It is these functions of financial markets that signal how the funds available from those who want to lend or invest funds will be allocated among those needing funds and raise those funds by issuing financial instruments.<\/li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Liquidity<\/strong> function provides an opportunity for investors to sell a financial instrument, since it is referred to as a measure of the ability to sell an asset at its fair market value at any time. Without liquidity, an investor would be forced to hold a financial instrument until conditions arise to sell it or the issuer is contractually obligated to pay it off.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>The function of <strong>reduction of<\/strong> <strong>transaction costs<\/strong> is performed, when financial market participants are charged and\/or bear the costs of trading a financial instrument. In market economies the economic rationale for the existence of institutions and instruments is related to transaction costs, thus the surviving institutions and instruments are those that have the lowest transaction costs.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>","h1Tag":null,"url":"resources\/finance-management-articles\/financial-instruments-rar18","status":"1","image_url":"http:\/\/cfs22.simplicdn.net\/ice9\/free_resources_article_thumb\/4-financial_instrument.jpg","created_at":"2012-01-19T00:00:00+00:00","updated_at":null,"infographic_url":null,"thumbnail_url":"NULL","shares":0,"likes":0,"comments":0,"engagement_score":0,"segments":[],"skills":[],"tags":[],"id":"56dfb0f1ac530efd098b456e"},{"course_id":[],"type":"article","label_id":"5","vertical":null,"name":"Financial Markets and the Prevailing Variations","display_name":"Financial Markets and the Prevailing Variations","author_name":"Eshna","author_description":"Eshna is a writer at Simplilearn.

The insured receives a contract, called the insurance policy, which details the conditions and circumstances under which the insured will be financially compensated.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Foreign exchange markets, which facilitate the trading of foreign exchange.The foreign exchange market assists international trade and investment by enabling currency conversion. For example, it permits a business in the United States to import goods from the European Union member states especially Eurozone members and pay Euros, even though its income is in United States dollars. It also supports direct speculation in the value of currencies, and the carry trade, speculation based on the interest rate differential between two currencies.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The capital markets may also be divided into primary markets and secondary markets. Newly formed (issued) securities are bought or sold in primary markets, such as during initial public offering. Secondary markets allow investors to buy and sell existing securities. The transactions in primary markets exist between issuers and investors, while in secondary market transactions exist among investors.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Liquidity is a crucial aspect of securities that are traded in secondary markets. Liquidity refers to the ease with which a security can be sold without a loss of value. Securities with an active secondary market mean that there are many buyers and sellers at a given point in time. Investors benefit from Liquid securities because they can sell their assets whenever they want; an illiquid security may force the seller to get rid of their asset at a large discount.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The financial market is broadly divided into 2 types: 1) Capital Market and 2) Money market.

A financial statement is a&nbsp;collection of data that is <span style=\"line-height: 20.7999992370605px;\">organized&nbsp;<\/span>according to logical and consistent accounting procedures. Its purpose is to convey an understanding of some financial aspects of a business firm. It may show a position of a period of time as in the case of a Balance Sheet, or may reveal a series of activities over a given period of time, as in the case of an Income Statement. Thus, the term &lsquo;financial statements&rsquo; generally refers to two basic statements: the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/resources\/finance-management-articles\">Balance Sheet<\/a> and the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/income-statements-rar179-article\">Income Statement<\/a>.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe Balance Sheet shows the financial position (condition) of the firm at a given point of time.

In some cases, the servicers of the underlying debt are also given ratings. In most cases, the issuers of securities are companies, special purpose entities, state and local governments, non-profit organizations, or national governments issuing debt-like securities (i.e. bonds) that can be traded on a secondary market. A credit rating for an issuer takes into consideration the issuer&#39;s credit worthiness (i.e., its ability to pay back a loan), and affects the interest rate applied to the particular security being issued.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The value of such security ratings has been widely questioned after the 2007-09 financial crises. In 2003, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission submitted a report to Congress detailing plans to launch an investigation into the anti-competitive practices of credit rating agencies and issues including conflicts of interest .More recently, ratings downgrades during the European sovereign debt crisis of 2010-11 have drawn criticism from the EU and individual countries<strong>.<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The regulation of CRAs by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the FED has eliminated competition between CRAs and practically forced market participants to use the services of the three big agencies, Standard and Poor&#39;s, Moody&#39;s and Fitch.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Conclusion:<\/strong><br \/><\/h3>\r\n<br \/>\r\nWe can inject some much needed optimism to our outlook with the observation that were it not for the constant amelioration of the regulatory framework over the past 20 years the economic consequences of the financial crisis would have been far more dramatic.

Market risk, also called &quot;<strong>systematic risk<\/strong>,&quot; cannot be eliminated through <a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/resources\/finance-management-videos\/project-finance-modeling-part-2-rrt3co38vd181\" title=\"diversification\">diversification<\/a>, though it can be hedged against. The risk that a major natural disaster will cause a decline in the market as a whole is an example of market risk. Other sources of market risk include recessions, political turmoil, changes in interest rates and terrorist attacks.<\/li>\r\n\t<li value=\"2\"><strong>Unsystematic Risk<\/strong>: Company or industry specific risk that is inherent in each investment.&nbsp;The amount of unsystematic risk can be reduced through appropriate diversification.<\/li>\r\n\t<li value=\"3\"><strong>Liquidity Risk: The<\/strong> risk stemming from the lack of marketability of an investment that cannot be bought or sold quickly enough to prevent or minimize a loss. Liquidity risk is typically reflected in unusually wide bid-ask spreads or large price movements (especially to the downside). The rule of thumb is that the smaller the size of the security or its issuer, the larger the liquidity risk.<\/li>\r\n\t<li value=\"4\"><strong>Credit Risk: <\/strong>The risk of loss of principal or loss of a financial reward stemming from a borrower&#39;s failure to repay a loan or otherwise meet a contractual obligation. Credit risk arises whenever a borrower is expecting to use future cash flows to pay a current debt. Investors are compensated for assuming <a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/resources\/finance-management-articles\/credit-risk-rar161\" title=\"Credit Risk\">credit risk <\/a>by way of interest payments from the borrower or issuer of a debt obligation. Credit risk is closely tied to the potential return of an investment, the most notable being that the yields on bonds correlate strongly to their perceived credit risk.<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li value=\"5\"><strong>Operational risk: <\/strong>An operational risk is defined as a risk incurred by an organization&rsquo;s internal activities. Operational risk is the broad discipline focusing on the risks arising from the people, systems and processes through which a company operates. It can also include other classes of risk, such as fraud, legal risks, physical or environmental risks.<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Financial Risk Modeling: <\/strong>Financial risk modeling refers to the use of formal econometric techniques to determine the aggregate risk in a financial portfolio. Risk modeling is one of many subtasks within the broader area of financial modeling.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 2pt;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/resources\/finance-management-videos\/country-risk-models-rrt3co39vd237\" title=\"Risk Modeling\">Risk modeling <\/a>uses a variety of techniques including market risk, value at risk (Vary), historical simulation (HS), or extreme value theory (EVT) in order to analyze a portfolio and make forecasts of the likely losses that would be incurred for a variety of risks. Such risks are typically grouped into credit risk, liquidity risk, market risk, and operational risk categories.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many large financial intermediary firms use risk modeling to help portfolio managers assess the amount of capital reserves to maintain and to help guide their purchases and sales of various classes of financial assets.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>Value at risk (VaR): <\/strong>Value at Risk (VaR) is a widely used risk measure of the risk of loss on a specific portfolio of financial assets. For a given portfolio, probability and time horizon, VaR is defined as a threshold value such that the probability that the mark-to-market loss on the portfolio over the given time horizon exceeds this value (assuming normal markets and no trading in the portfolio) is the given probability level.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>For example, if a portfolio of stocks has a one-day 5% VaR of $1 million, there is a 0.05 probability that the portfolio will fall in value by more than $1 million over a one day period if there is no trading. Informally, a loss of $1 million or more on this portfolio is expected on 1 day out of 20 days (because of 5% probability). A loss which exceeds the VaR threshold is termed a &ldquo;VaR break.<\/li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Extreme value theory<\/strong> or <strong>extreme value analysis<\/strong> (<strong>EVA<\/strong>) is a branch of statistics dealing with the extreme deviations from the median of probability distributions. It seeks to assess, from a given ordered sample of a given random variable, the probability of events that are more extreme than any observed prior. Extreme value analysis is widely used in many disciplines, ranging from structural engineering, finance, earth sciences, traffic prediction, geological engineering, etc.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n","h1Tag":null,"url":"resources\/finance-management-articles\/financial-risk-management-rar24","status":null,"image_url":"http:\/\/cfs22.simplicdn.net\/ice9\/free_resources_article_thumb\/freeresources_517e39db6eb62.jpg","created_at":"2016-03-09T05:13:21+00:00","updated_at":null,"infographic_url":null,"thumbnail_url":"NULL","shares":0,"likes":0,"comments":0,"engagement_score":0,"segments":[],"skills":[],"tags":[],"id":"56dfb0f1ac530efd098b4573"},{"course_id":["148"],"type":"article","label_id":"5","vertical":"business","name":"Financial Statement Analysis - Framework and Application","display_name":"Financial Statement Analysis - Framework and Application","author_name":"Eshna","author_description":"Eshna is a writer at Simplilearn.

Thus, for example, while a financial economist might study the structural reasons why a company may have a certain share price, a financial mathematician may take the share price as a given, and attempt to use stochastic calculus to obtain the corresponding value of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/resources\/finance-management-articles\/derivatives-as-a-tool-of-financial-risk-management-rar132\">derivatives<\/a> of the stock. The fundamental theorem of arbitrage-free pricing is one of the key theorems in mathematical finance, while the Black&ndash;Scholes equation and formula are amongst the key results.\r\n\r\n<p>Mathematical finance also overlaps heavily with the field of computational finance (as well as financial engineering). The latter focuses on application, while the former focuses on modeling and derivation, often by help of stochastic asset models. In general, there exist two separate branches of finance that require advanced quantitative techniques: derivatives pricing on the one hand, and risk- and portfolio management on the other.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nA <strong>quantitative analyst<\/strong> is a person who works in finance using numerical or quantitative techniques<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<strong>Types of quantitative analyst:<\/strong><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<strong>1. Front office quantitative analyst:<\/strong> In trading and sales operations, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/resources\/project-management-videos\/perform-quantitative-risk-analysis-rrt3co14vd62\">quantitative analysis<\/a> work to determine prices, manage risk, and identify profitable opportunities. Historically, this was a distinct activity from trading but the boundary between a desk quantitative analyst and a quantitative trader is increasingly blurred, and it is now difficult to enter trading as a profession without at least some quantitative analysis education. In the field of algorithmic trading it has reached the point where there is little meaningful difference. Front office work favors a higher speed to quality ratio, with a greater emphasis on solutions to specific problems than detailed modeling. FOQs typically are significantly better paid than those in back office, risk, and model validation. Although highly skilled analysts, FOQs frequently lack software engineering experience or formal training, and bound by time constraints and business pressures tactical solutions are often adopted.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n2.<strong> Quantitative investment management<\/strong>: Quantitative analysis is used extensively by asset managers. Some, such as AQR or Barclays, rely almost exclusively on quantitative strategies while others, such as Pico, Blackrock or Citadel use a mix of quantitative and fundamental methods. Virtually all large asset managers and hedge funds rely to some degree on quantitative methods.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n3.<strong> Library quantitative analysis<\/strong>: Major firms invest large sums in an attempt to produce standard methods of evaluating prices and risk. These differ from front office tools in that Excel is very rare, with most development being in C++, though Java and C# are sometimes used in non-performance critical tasks. LQs spend more time modeling ensuring the analytics are both efficient and correct, though there is tension between LQs and FOQs on the validity of their results. LQs are required to understand techniques such as Monte Carlo simulations and finite difference methods, as well as the nature of the products being modeled.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n4.<strong>Algorithmic trading quantitative analyst<\/strong>: Often the highest paid form of Quant, ATQs make use of methods taken from signal processing, game theory, gambling Kelly criterion, market microstructure, econometrics, and time series analysis. Algorithmic trading includes statistical arbitrage, but includes techniques largely based upon speed of response, to the extent that some ATQs modify hardware and Linux kernels to achieve ultra-low latency.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n5. <strong>Risk management<\/strong>: This has grown in importance in recent years, as the credit crisis exposed holes in the mechanisms used to ensure that positions were correctly hedged, though in no bank does the pay in risk approach that in front office. A core technique is value at risk, and this is backed up with various forms of stress testing and direct analysis of the positions and models used by traders.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n6. <strong>Innovation<\/strong>: In the aftermath of the financial crisis, there surfaced the recognition that quantitative valuation methods were generally too narrow in their approach. An agreed upon fix adopted by numerous financial institutions has been to improve collaboration through continuous improvement and thought leadership. This has led to the creation of collaborative environments in order to produce the most robust statistical models available. Through working with a large pool of some of the world&#39;s most talented quantitative analysts, economists and mathematicians from the financial industry and academia, transparency continues to be improved, leading to constant improvement.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n7. <strong>Model validation<\/strong>: MV takes the models and methods developed by front office, library, and modeling quants and determines their validity and correctness. The MV group might well be seen as a superset of the quant operations in a financial institution, since it must deal with new and advanced new models and trading techniques from across the firm. However, the pay structure in all firms is such that MV groups struggle to attract and retain adequate staff, often with talented quantitative analysts leaving at the first opportunity. This gravely impacts corporate ability to manage model risk, or to ensure that the positions being held are correctly valued. An MV quantitative analyst will typically earn a fraction of quantitative analysts in other groups with similar length of experience.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n8. <strong>Quantitative developer<\/strong>: Quant developers are computer specialists that assist, implement and maintain the quant models. They tend to be highly specialized language technicians that bridge the gap between IT and quantitative analysts.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<strong>Conclusion: <\/strong>Quantitative Finance is a combination of various Mathematical Tools, coupled with financial theory to get timely and precise outputs.<\/p>","h1Tag":"Application of Quantitative Finance to Financial Markets","url":"resources\/finance-management-articles\/quantitative-finance-rar26","status":null,"image_url":"http:\/\/cfs22.simplicdn.net\/ice9\/free_resources_article_thumb\/freeresources_517e3a2a942af.jpg","created_at":"2016-03-09T05:13:21+00:00","updated_at":null,"infographic_url":null,"thumbnail_url":"NULL","shares":0,"likes":0,"comments":0,"engagement_score":0,"segments":[],"skills":[],"tags":[],"id":"56dfb0f1ac530efd098b4575"},{"course_id":[],"type":"article","label_id":"3","vertical":null,"name":"Authentication - A Detailed Insight on Application and Process","display_name":"Authentication - A Detailed Insight on Application and Process","author_name":"Eshna","author_description":"Eshna is a writer at Simplilearn.

This process involves confirming the identity of a person \/software program(s).This process of authentication also includes tracing the origins of the artifact, or ensuring that a product is what it&rsquo;s packaging and labeling claims to be. In other words, authentication is a process that involves verifying the validity of at least one form of identification. Authentication is in fact verification that the users claimed identity is valid. The <a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/it-security-management\">IT security certifications<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/it-security-management\/ceh-certification\">CEH exams<\/a> enable participants to effectively handle any security-related issues.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The three general factors used for authentication are: something a person knows, something the person has and something a person is. The testing or reconciliation of evidence of a user&#39;s identity. It establishes the user&#39;s identity and ensures that the users are who they say they are.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Authentication can also be defined as a process that ensures and confirms a user&rsquo;s identity. The five pillars of information assurance are integrity, availability, confidentiality, non-repudiation and authentication. Authentication is one of the five pillars.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Single-factor authentication<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Single-factor authentication is the employment of one of the above mentioned factors.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Two-factor authentication<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Two-factor authentication is employed when elements representing two factors are required for authentication; the term two-factor authentication is applied. Example: A bank debit card (something the user has\/possess) and a PIN (something the user knows). Business networks may require users to provide a password (knowledge factor) and a pseudo random number from a security token (ownership factor). Access to a very-high-security system might require a mantrap screening of height, weight, facial, and fingerprint checks (several inherence factor elements) plus a PIN and a day code (knowledge factor elements), but this is still a two-factor authentication.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Multi-factor authentication<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Multi-factor authentication is as an approach to security authentication, which requires that the user of a system provide more than one form of verification in order to prove their identity and allow access to the system.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Password<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A password is a secret word or string of characters that is used for user authentication to prove identity, or for access approval to gain access to a resource.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Passwords are a common practice for validating a user&rsquo;s identity during the authentication process. This one-time password\u008e provides maximum security because a new password is required for each new logon. A password that is the same for each logon is called a static password. A password that changes with each logon is termed a dynamic password.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>A passphrase is a sequence of characters that is usually longer than the allotted number for a password. The passphrase is converted into a virtual password by the system.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>A cognitive password is based on a user&rsquo;s opinion or life experience.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The security of a password-protected system depends on several factors. The overall system must, of course, be designed for sound security, with protection against computer viruses, man-in-the-middle attacks and the like. Physical security issues are also a concern, from deterring shoulder surfing to more sophisticated physical threats such as video cameras and keyboard sniffers.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Passwords are vulnerable to interception (i.e., &quot;snooping&quot;) while being transmitted to the authenticating machine or person. If the password is carried as electrical signals on unsecured physical wiring between the user access point and the central system controlling the password database, it is subject to snooping by wiretapping methods. If it is carried as packetized data over the Internet, anyone able to watch the packets containing the logon information can snoop with a very low probability of detection.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Emails are mainly used to distribute passwords. As we know most emails are sent as cleartext, password is available without effort during transport to any eavesdropper. Further, the email will be stored on at least two computers as cleartext i.e. on the sender&#39;s and the recipient&#39;s computer. If it passes through intermediate systems during its travels, it will probably be stored on those as well, at least for some time. Attempts to delete an email from all these vulnerabilities may, or may not, succeed; backups or history files or caches on any of several systems may still contain the email. Indeed merely identifying every one of those systems may be difficult. Emailed passwords are an insecure method of distribution.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Biometrics<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>An alternative to using passwords for authentication in logical or technical access control is biometrics. Biometrics is based on the Type 3 authentication mechanism: something you are. Biometrics refers to the identification of humans by their characteristics or traits. Biometrics is used in computer science as a form of identification and access control. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/resources\/it-security-management\/biometrics-applications\">Biometrics <\/a>is used for identification in physical controls and for authentication in logical controls.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are three main performance measures in biometrics:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>False Rejection Rate (FRR) or Type I Error<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The percentage of valid subjects that are falsely rejected<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>False Acceptance Rate (FAR) or Type II Error<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The percentage of invalid subjects that are falsely accepted<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Crossover Error Rate (CER) or Equal Error Rate (EER)<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The percent in which the FRR equals the FAR<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Product authentication<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A Security hologram label on an electronics box for authentication. Counterfeit products are often offered to consumers as being authentic. Counterfeit consumer goods such as electronics, music, apparel, and Counterfeit medications have been sold as being legitimate. Efforts to control the supply chain and educate consumers to evaluate the packaging and labeling help ensure that authentic products are sold and used.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Video authentication<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>It is sometimes necessary to authenticate the veracity of video recordings used as evidence in judicial proceedings. So video authentication is a process which ascertains that the content in a given video is authentic and exactly same as when captured. For verifying the originality of received video content, and to detect malicious tampering and preventing various types of forgeries, performed on video data, video authentication techniques are used.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;A video authentication system ensures the integrity of digital video and verifies that whether the given video has been tampered or not. But in most of the cases, especially in the court of law, it may be more beneficial if the authentication system can tell where the tampering happens and how the video is tampered.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Digital signature<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A <a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/resources\/it-security-management-articles\/digital-certificates-rar218\">digital signature <\/a>or digital signature scheme is a mathematical scheme for demonstrating the authenticity of a digital message or document. The purpose of digital signatures is to detect unauthorized modifications of data and to authenticate the identity of the signatories and non-repudiation.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>A digital signature scheme typically consists of three algorithms:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>A key generation algorithm that selects a private key uniformly at random from a set of possible private keys. The algorithm outputs the private key and a corresponding public key. A signing algorithm that, given a message and a private key, produces a signature. A signature verifying algorithm that, given a message, public key and a signature, either accepts or rejects the message&#39;s claim to authenticity.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two main properties are required. First, a signature generated from a fixed message and fixed private key should verify the authenticity of that message by using the corresponding public key. Secondly, it should be computationally infeasible to generate a valid signature for a party who does not possess the private key.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Challenge&ndash;Response Authentication<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In computer security, challenge&ndash;response authentication is an authentication process that verifies an identity by requiring correct authentication information to be provided in response to a challenge.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Challenge-response authentication is a group or family of protocols characterized by one entity sending a challenge to another entity. The second entity must respond with the appropriate answer to be authenticated.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>A simple example of this is password authentication. The challenge is from a server asking the client for a password to authenticate the client&#39;s identity so that the client can be served.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Challenge-response tokens<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A workstation or system generates a random challenge string, and the owner enters the string into the token along with the proper PIN. The token generates a response that is then entered into the workstation or system. The authentication mechanism in the workstation or system then determines whether the owner should be authenticated.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<hr \/>We provide Big Data and Hadoop training in the following cities:<br \/>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"1\" style=\"width: 150px;\">\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/big-data-and-analytics\/big-data-and-hadoop-training-bangalore\/pct47co15\">BANGALORE<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t<\/tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/big-data-and-analytics\/big-data-and-hadoop-training-chennai\/pct27co15\">CHENNAI<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t<\/tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/big-data-and-analytics\/big-data-and-hadoop-training-delhi\/pct66co15#\/ilt\">DELHI<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t<\/tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/big-data-and-analytics\/big-data-and-hadoop-training-hyderabad\/pct46co15#\/ilt\">HYDERABAD<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t<\/tr>\r\n\t<\/tbody>\r\n<\/table>","h1Tag":"Authentication - A Detailed Insight on Application and Process","url":"resources\/it-security-management-articles\/understanding-authentication-rar27","status":null,"image_url":"http:\/\/cfs22.simplicdn.net\/ice9\/free_resources_article_thumb\/freeresources_517f99e143004.jpg","created_at":"2016-03-09T05:13:21+00:00","updated_at":null,"infographic_url":null,"thumbnail_url":"NULL","shares":0,"likes":0,"comments":0,"engagement_score":0,"segments":[],"skills":[],"tags":[],"id":"56dfb0f1ac530efd098b4576"},{"course_id":[],"type":"article","label_id":"3","vertical":null,"name":"Authentication \u2013 A Brief Introduction to its Diverse Types","display_name":"Authentication \u2013 A Brief Introduction to its Diverse Types","author_name":null,"author_description":null,"author_image":null,"author_linkedin_profile":null,"author_twitter_profile":null,"short_description":null,"article_content":"<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Authentication Part-II<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>Product Authentication<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Product <a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/resources\/it-security-management-articles\/understanding-authentication-rar27\">authentication <\/a>can be a security hologram label on a box of a product for authentication.

title=\"product authendication\" \/><\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Video Authentication<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>It is sometimes necessary to authenticate the veracity of video recordings used as evidence in judicial proceedings. Therefore, video authentication is a process which ascertains that the content in a given video is authentic and exactly same as when captured. For verifying the originality of received video content, and to detect malicious tampering and preventing various types of forgeries, performed on video data, video authentication techniques are used.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;A video authentication system ensures the integrity of digital video and verifies that whether the given video has been tampered or not. But in most of the cases, especially in the court of law, it may be more beneficial if the authentication system can tell where the tampering happens and how the video is tampered.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Digital Signature<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A <a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/resources\/it-security-management-articles\/digital-certificates-rar218\">Digital Signature <\/a>is a mathematical approach for demonstrating the authenticity of a digital message or document. The purpose of digital signatures is to detect unauthorized modifications of data and to authenticate the identity of the signatories and non-repudiation.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>A digital signature scheme typically consists of three algorithms:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>A key generation algorithm that selects a private key uniformly at random from a set of possible private keys. The algorithm outputs the private key and a corresponding public key. A signing algorithm that, given a message and a private key, produces a signature. A signature verifying algorithm that, given a message, public key and a signature, either accepts or rejects the message&#39;s claim to authenticity.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two main properties are required. First, a signature generated from a fixed message and fixed private key should verify the authenticity of that message by using the corresponding public key. Secondly, it should be computationally infeasible to generate a valid signature for a party who does not possess the private key.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Challenge&ndash;Response Authentication<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In computer security, challenge&ndash;response authentication is an authentication process that verifies an identity by requiring correct authentication information to be provided in response to a challenge.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Challenge-response authentication is a group or family of protocols characterized by one entity sending a challenge to another entity. The second entity must respond with the appropriate answer to be authenticated.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>A simple example of this is password authentication. The challenge is from a server asking the client for a password to authenticate the client&#39;s identity so that the client can be served.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Challenge-response tokens<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A workstation or system generates a random challenge string, and the owner enters the string into the token along with the proper PIN. The token generates a response that is then entered into the workstation or system. The authentication mechanism in the workstation or system then determines whether the owner should be authenticated.<br \/>\r\n&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<hr \/>We provide classroom training for Certified Ethical Hacking in the following cities:<br \/>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"1\" style=\"width: 300px;\">\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/it-security-management\/ceh-certification-bangalore\/pct47co105\">BANGALORE<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/it-security-management\/ceh-certification-hyderabad\/pct46co105\">HYDERABAD<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t<\/tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/it-security-management\/ceh-certification-chennai\/pct27co105\">CHENNAI<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>&nbsp;<\/td>\r\n\t\t<\/tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/it-security-management\/ceh-certification-pune\/pct55co105\">PUNE<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>&nbsp;<\/td>\r\n\t\t<\/tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/it-security-management\/ceh-certification-delhi\/pct66co105\">DELHI<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>&nbsp;<\/td>\r\n\t\t<\/tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/it-security-management\/ceh-certification-mumbai\/pct45co105\">MUMBAI<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>&nbsp;<\/td>\r\n\t\t<\/tr>\r\n\t<\/tbody>\r\n<\/table>\r\n","h1Tag":null,"url":"resources\/it-security-management-articles\/understanding-authentication-part-ii-rar28","status":null,"image_url":"http:\/\/cfs22.simplicdn.net\/ice9\/free_resources_article_thumb\/freeresources_517fa008e31a8.jpg","created_at":"2016-03-09T05:13:21+00:00","updated_at":null,"infographic_url":null,"thumbnail_url":"NULL","shares":0,"likes":0,"comments":0,"engagement_score":0,"segments":[],"skills":[],"tags":[],"id":"56dfb0f1ac530efd098b4577"},{"course_id":[],"type":"article","label_id":"3","vertical":null,"name":"Cryptography - Rudimentary Notions and Terminologies","display_name":"Cryptography - Rudimentary Notions and Terminologies","author_name":null,"author_description":null,"author_image":null,"author_linkedin_profile":null,"author_twitter_profile":null,"short_description":null,"article_content":"<h2 align=\"center\">Cryptography<\/h2>\r\nCryptography is the practice and study of using mathematical algorithm to encrypt and decrypt data.

Symmetric-key algorithms are a class of algorithms for cryptography that use the same cryptographic keys for both encryption of plaintext and decryption of ciphertext.<br \/>\r\nThe following are examples of symmetric algorithm:\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Data Encryption Standard (DES)<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Triple- DES<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Blowfish<\/li>\r\n\t<li>IDEA (International Data Encryption Algorithm)<\/li>\r\n\t<li>RC4 , RC5 and RC6<\/li>\r\n\t<li>AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nThe following are strength and weakness of symmetric-key algorithms \/ systems:\r\n\r\n<h3>Strength<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>If we use large key size they are hard to break<\/li>\r\n\t<li>They are faster as compared to asymmetric key algorithms<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>Weakness<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Key management is a challenge<\/li>\r\n\t<li>This system provides confidentiality only<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Requires an out of band \/ secure mechanism to deliver key<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>Asymmetric key algorithms<\/h3>\r\nAsymmetric key algorithm is also known as public-key cryptography. They refer to a class of cryptographic system requiring two separate keys, one of which is secret and one of which is public. Public key cryptography is an asymmetric scheme that uses a pair of keys for encryption: a public key, which encrypts data, and a corresponding private, or secret key for decryption.<br \/>\r\nThe following are examples of asymmetric algorithm:\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>DSA (Digital Signature Algorithm)<\/li>\r\n\t<li>El Gamal<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Diffie Hellman<\/li>\r\n\t<li>ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptosystem)<\/li>\r\n\t<li>&nbsp;RSA<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nThe following are strength and weakness of asymmetric-key algorithms \/ systems:\r\n\r\n<h3>Strength<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>It provides authentication and non-repudiation<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Better key distribution as compared to symmetric systems<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Better scalability<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>Weakness<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>It works slower than symmetric key algorithm<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>Block Cipher<\/h3>\r\nA block cipher is a deterministic algorithm operating on fixed-length groups of bits, called blocks, with an unvarying transformation that is specified by a symmetric key. Block ciphers are important elementary components in the design of many cryptographic protocols, and are widely used to implement encryption of bulk data.<br \/>\r\nA strong cipher contains the right level of two main attributes i.e. confusion and diffusion. Confusion is commonly carried out through substitution and diffusion uses transposition.\r\n<h3>Stream Cipher<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A stream cipher is a symmetric key cipher where plaintext digits are combined with a pseudorandom cipher digit stream (keystream). In a stream cipher each plaintext digit is encrypted one at a time with the corresponding digit of the keystream, to give a digit of the cyphertext stream.<br \/>\r\nWith stream ciphers the bits generated by the keystream generator are XORed with the bits of the plaintext message.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<hr \/>We provide <a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/it-security-management\/cisa-certification-training\">CISA Training<\/a> workshops in the following cities:<br \/>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width: 213px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/it-security-management\/cisa-certification-training-baltimore\/pct2121co32\">BALTIMORE<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width: 213px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/it-security-management\/cisa-certification-training-dallas\/pct2172co32\">DALLAS<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width: 213px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/it-security-management\/cisa-certification-training-hyderabad\/pct46co32\">HYDERABAD<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t<\/tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width: 213px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/it-security-management\/cisa-certification-training-houston\/pct2140co32\">HOUSTON<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width: 213px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/it-security-management\/cisa-certification-training-pune\/pct55co32\">PUNE<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width: 213px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/it-security-management\/cisa-certification-training-bangalore\/pct47co32\">BANGALORE<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t<\/tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width: 213px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/it-security-management\/cisa-certification-training-san-francisco\/pct2169co32\">SAN FRANCISCO<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width: 213px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/it-security-management\/cisa-certification-training-kuwait\/pct17243co32\">KUWAIT<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width: 213px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/it-security-management\/cisa-certification-training-mumbai\/pct45co32\">MUMBAI<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t<\/tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width: 213px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/it-security-management\/cisa-certification-training-washington\/pct2141co32\">WASHINGTON<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width: 213px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/it-security-management\/cisa-certification-training-kolkata\/pct54co32\">KOLKATA<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width: 213px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/it-security-management\/cisa-certification-training-atlanta\/pct2138co32\">ATLANTA<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t<\/tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width: 213px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/it-security-management\/cisa-certification-training-austin\/pct2152co32\">AUSTIN<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width: 213px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/it-security-management\/cisa-certification-training-chennai\/pct27co32\">CHENNAI<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width: 213px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/it-security-management\/cisa-certification-training-delhi\/pct66co32\">DELHI<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t<\/tr>\r\n\t<\/tbody>\r\n<\/table>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;","h1Tag":null,"url":"resources\/it-security-management-articles\/understanding-cryptography-rar29","status":null,"image_url":"http:\/\/cfs22.simplicdn.net\/ice9\/free_resources_article_thumb\/freeresources_517e5a857fc02.jpg","created_at":"2016-03-09T05:13:21+00:00","updated_at":null,"infographic_url":null,"thumbnail_url":"NULL","shares":0,"likes":0,"comments":0,"engagement_score":0,"segments":[],"skills":[],"tags":[],"id":"56dfb0f1ac530efd098b4578"},{"course_id":["240"],"type":"article","label_id":"3","vertical":"technology","name":"Elementary Concepts of Data Security and Protection","display_name":"Elementary Concepts of Data Security and Protection","author_name":"Eshna","author_description":"Eshna is a writer at Simplilearn.

Unfortunately, your organization data may also hold importance to other organizations\/ individuals. As a security professional you need to make sure that it is secure from unauthorized access.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/information-management-and-data-security-rrt3co145vd427-video\">Data Security <\/a>can be defined as the protection of data from unauthorized (accidental or intentional or unintentional or malicious) modification, destruction, or disclosure. We can also define Data Security as the means protecting a database from destructive forces and the unwanted actions of unauthorized users.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Data Protection<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The first thing an organization&nbsp;needs to do is figure out&nbsp;what sensitive data they possess, what is it&#39;s utility, and where it is located. Secondly, the organization needs to make sure that they segregate the important data. As a security professional, you need to minimize the storage of sensitive data to as few a devices as possible, and ensure that those devices are isolated from the network and the rest of the data. Maintainence of security information thus becomes easier.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Disk Encryption<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Disk encryption refers to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/encryption-and-key-management-rrt3co145vd433-video\">encryption technology <\/a>that encrypts data on a hard disk drive. It is a process that ensures that files are always stored on a disk in an encrypted form. The files stored on the disk are available to the operating system and applications in readable form while the system is running and unlocked by a trusted user. Reading the encrypted sectors without permission will return garbled random-looking data instead of the actual files.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Data Masking<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Data masking is the process of obscuring or masking specific data elements within data stores. We use data masking strategies and techniques to obscure or de-identify specific data within a database table or flat file ensuring the data security is maintained and sensitive customer information is not leaked outside the authorized environments. The data masking algorithms are applied across multiple tables, applications and environments, so, referential and business integrity will always be maintained. Other terms for &quot;data masking&quot; may include: data obfuscation, data scrambling, data anonymization and data cleansing.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Data Encryption VS Data Masking<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<p>As a data security professional there lies a common misconception that data encryption is a form of data masking.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>As we know,&nbsp;encryption is a process for securing communications from unauthorized eavesdropping. On the other hand data masking is a process or method used to protect the content of data in environments other then production while ensuring the referential integrity of the original production data is maintained. Since the only purpose is to protect the data with no aim to re-construct the original data, we should see the&nbsp;process of data masking to be irreversible.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Data Erasure<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Data erasure, also known as, data clearing or data wiping is a software-based method of overwriting data that completely destroys all electronic data residing on a hard disk drive or other digital media. When media is erased it is also said to be sanitized. In the military or government terms, data erasure means to erase information from the media so that it is not retrievable using routine OS (operating system) commands or available recovery software products.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you fail to erase data properly it could result in:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Identity theft<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Government and\/or civil liability<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Fines or lawsuits<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Damage to an organization&rsquo;s reputation<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Loss in consumer confidence<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Destroying data can be challenging. Even damaged hard drives still contain data which can be recovered by experts. In order to ensure that data is completely destroyed beyond recovery, it is imperative to use a secure method of data erasure.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Methods of Data Destruction<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The following are most commonly used methods of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/understanding-data-security-rar31-article\">data destruction<\/a>:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Delete<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Degauss<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Physical destruction<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Software Overwrite<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>Delete<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>All Delete and Format commands (even with switches such as Format C: \/D) affect only the File Allocation Table (FAT) and does not actually erase any data. &nbsp;Until the &ldquo;deleted&rdquo; data is overwritten with other data, it still exists and poses a significant danger to any organization. Deleting\/formatting data is an extremely ineffective method of data destruction and should be avoided.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Degaussing<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>When we degauss, the process involves using a machine that produces a strong electromagnetic field to destroy all magnetically recorded data. This process of data destruction was effective in the past as a strong electromagnetic field was not needed to destroy data. However, with the use of modern hard drives, a much stronger&nbsp;electromagnetic field is required in order to ensure a complete erasure. There is no way to guarantee that a particular degassing machine will do a thorough job and therefore poses a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/concepts-of-security-risk-management-rar44-article\">security risk<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Physical Destruction<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>When we use the process of physical destruction, hard drives and other storage media are usually shredded into tiny pieces by large mechanical shredders\/machines. This is considered an effective way of destroying data and preventing data. Drilling holes in a hard drive is another method of physical destruction. It is important to remember that mechanical shredding, drilling and hammering don&rsquo;t actually destroy data but make the drive inoperable preventing data recovery.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Software Overwrite<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A software based data destruction process involves using a special application or software program to write patterns of meaningless data onto each of the hard drive&rsquo;s sectors. This process works by overwriting the data with a combination of 1&rsquo;s and 0&rsquo;s. The level of security depends on the number of times the entire hard drive is written over.

This remanence can be enough to reconstruct the data and restore it to readable form. If the media is reassigned, then an unauthorized individual could gain access to your sensitive data.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Data Recovery<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Data recovery is the process or methodology of salvaging or recovering data from damaged, failed, corrupted, or inaccessible secondary storage media when it cannot be accessed normally. Often the data are being salvaged from storage media such as internal or external hard disk drives, solid-state drives (SSD), USB flash drive, storage tapes, CDs, DVDs, RAID, and other electronics. Recovery may be required due to physical damage to the storage device or logical damage to the file system that prevents it from being mounted by the host operating system.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Recovery Techniques<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Multiple techniques are involved to recover data from physically damaged hardware.

Keeping corporate information assets safe takes a combination of smart strategy and intelligent technology choices. IT managers must stay on top of the latest security threats, understand the latest prevention mechanisms and, perhaps toughest of all, keep users complying with corporate safeguards.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is general agreement among certified security professionals and others that the overall objective of information security is to preserve the availability, integrity, and confidentiality of an organization&rsquo;s information. Effective <a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/it-security-management\" title=\"IT security management\">IT security management <\/a>also calls for providing accountability and assurance. Enterprise security architecture is the component of the overall enterprise architecture designed specifically to fulfill these objectives. A critical element of enterprise information security is physical security, which is the linchpin of a secure environment.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Enterprise Security Architecture<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The term Enterprise security architecture may also be considered of as the overall framework for fulfilling the objectives while satisfying the security demands placed on the IT service organization by its customers. It includes all aspects of security governance, security technology architecture, and security operations required to protect the information technology assets of the enterprise.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>To meet the needs of enterprise security, the security policy are defined and to meet security policy, a required protection level needs to be met. The system security architecture is a high level design that works as a framework. As an organization we need to understand the total environment, we should take time to understand its security requirement and should work in laying a framework that maps the two. This approach is nothing but a way to define the enterprise level security architecture. The implementation of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/resources\/it-security-management-articles\/enterprise-security-rar32\" title=\"enterprise security\">enterprise security <\/a>architecture ensures chaos is less and security as a whole is dealt proactively. &nbsp;Or simply we can define Enterprise security architecture as a unifying framework and reusable services that implement policy, standard and risk management decision. The purpose of the security architecture is to bring focus to the key areas of concern for the enterprise, highlighting decision criteria and context for each domain.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Working at Enterprise level requires different thinking than just working at system or other related level. While developing enterprise level security architecture one needs to understand the strategic alignment, business enablement and effectiveness of security policies. Example, Zachman framework is used as a model for <a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/resources\/it-security-management-videos\/security-architecture-rrt3co34vd99\" title=\"Security architecture\">security architecture<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The practice of enterprise <a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/resources\/it-security-management-videos\/security-architecture-rrt3co34vd99\" title=\"information security architecture\">information security architecture<\/a> involves developing an architecture security framework to describe a series of &quot;current&quot;, &quot;intermediate&quot; and &quot;target&quot; reference architectures and applying them to align programs of change. These frameworks detail the organizations, roles, entities and relationships that exist or should exist to perform a set of business processes. This framework will provide a rigorous taxonomy and ontology that clearly identifies what processes a business performs and detailed information about how those processes are executed and secured. The end product is a set of artifacts that describe in varying degrees of detail exactly what and how a business operates and what security controls are required. These artifacts are often graphical.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Enterprise Network Security<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We all know that for any business network to function properly and efficiently, it needs to be protected from possibly harmful traffic. Information and applications that are retrieved and transmitted over a network without protection can fall victim to a variety of attacks such as phishing, Trojan horses, spyware, self-propagating worms and the exploitation of vendor-specific vulnerabilities. If these attacks take place than they can obstruct connectivity, slow the processing of network traffic into bottlenecks, and even potentially cause damage severe enough to crash an entire system. With&nbsp;Enterprise network security, businesses are provided the preventative real-time protection they need to maintain a highly available, effective information delivery network. Along with routine system analysis practices, network security can also safeguard system using anti-virus software and firewalls to prevent attacks before they cause service disruptions. In the event that an attacker does gain access, security measures should be able to detect the intrusion and eliminate it before it causes any server damage.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<hr \/>We provide CISSP training in the following cities:<br \/>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width: 213px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/it-security-management\/cissp-certification-training-orlando\/pct2833co34\">ORLANDO<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width: 213px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/it-security-management\/cissp-certification-training-jeddah\/pct570co34\">JEDDAH<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width: 213px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/it-security-management\/cissp-certification-training-albany\/pct2805co34\">ALBANY<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t<\/tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width: 213px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/it-security-management\/cissp-certification-training-new-orleans\/pct3180co34\">NEW ORLEANS<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width: 213px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/it-security-management\/cissp-certification-training-portland\/pct2268co34\">PORTLAND<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width: 213px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/it-security-management\/cissp-certification-training-hyderabad\/pct46co34\">HYDERABAD<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t<\/tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width: 213px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/it-security-management\/cissp-certification-training-orange-county\/pct2504co34\">ORANGE COUNTY<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width: 213px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/it-security-management\/cissp-certification-training-bangalore\/pct47co34\">BANGALORE<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width: 213px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/it-security-management\/cissp-certification-training-mumbai\/pct45co34\">MUMBAI<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t<\/tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width: 213px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/it-security-management\/cissp-certification-training-phoenix\/pct2193co34\">PHOENIX<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width: 213px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/it-security-management\/cissp-certification-training-kolkata\/pct54co34\">KOLKATA<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width: 213px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/it-security-management\/cissp-certification-training-delhi\/pct66co34\">DELHI<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t<\/tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width: 213px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/it-security-management\/cissp-certification-training-richmond\/pct2851co34\">RICHMOND<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width: 213px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/it-security-management\/cissp-certification-training-chennai\/pct27co34\">CHENNAI<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width: 213px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/it-security-management\/cissp-certification-training-pune\/pct55co34\">PUNE<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t<\/tr>\r\n\t<\/tbody>\r\n<\/table>\r\n","h1Tag":null,"url":"resources\/it-security-management-articles\/enterprise-security-rar32","status":null,"image_url":"http:\/\/cfs22.simplicdn.net\/ice9\/free_resources_article_thumb\/freeresources_517fa0a9b8160.jpg","created_at":"2016-03-09T05:13:21+00:00","updated_at":null,"infographic_url":null,"thumbnail_url":"NULL","shares":0,"likes":0,"comments":0,"engagement_score":0,"segments":[],"skills":[],"tags":[],"id":"56dfb0f1ac530efd098b457b"},{"course_id":[],"type":"article","label_id":"3","vertical":null,"name":"Developing Enterprise Security - Policies and Threats","display_name":"Developing Enterprise Security - Policies and Threats","author_name":null,"author_description":null,"author_image":null,"author_linkedin_profile":null,"author_twitter_profile":null,"short_description":null,"article_content":"<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Enterprise Security Part-II<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>Network Security<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Network security is the term which consists of the provisions and policies adopted by a network administrator and the teams to prevent and monitor unauthorized access, misuse, modification, or denial of a computer network and network-accessible resources. Network security involves the authorization of access to data in a network, which is controlled by the network administrator. Users choose or are assigned an ID and password or other authenticating information that allows them access to information and programs within their authority.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>We can accomplish network security by using both hardware and software. The software must be constantly updated and managed to protect you from all new threats.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many components are usually part of network security system. Ideally, all components work together, which minimizes maintenance and improves security.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Network security components often include:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Anti-virus and anti-spyware<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Firewall, to block unauthorized access to your network<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Intrusion prevention systems (IPS), to identify fast-spreading threats, such as zero-day or zero-hour attacks<\/li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/resources\/it-security-management\/virtual-private-network\" title=\"Virtual Private Networks\">Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)<\/a>, to provide secure remote access<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>Network Security Threats<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Many network security threats today are spread over the Internet. The most common one are:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Viruses, worms, and Trojan horses<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Spyware and adware<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Zero-day attacks, also called zero-hour attacks<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Hacker attacks<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Denial of service attacks<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Data interception and theft<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Identity theft<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>Security Policies<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/resources\/it-security-management\/security-policies-elements-and-guidelines\" title=\"Security Policies\">Security Policies <\/a>and security standards are one of the most important parts of the enterprise requirement management process. Security policies are established at executive level and have the characteristics like durability, resistant to impulsive change, and not technology specific. Many of today&#39;s existing enterprise security infrastructures are the result of an incremental and evolutionary process. As a consequence, they generally comprise a series of point solutions, upgrades, and add-ons that are not seamlessly integrated, creating gaps in their overall security effectiveness. Supporting and maintaining these security solutions requires significant amounts of dedicated staff time, and because of the unknown gaps in security, they are vulnerable to attacks that too often lead to expensive cleanup efforts and\/or the theft of a business&#39;&nbsp; private, personal, and confidential digital information.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Information Assurance<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The information assurance process typically begins with the enumeration and classification of the information assets to be protected. Next, the IA practitioner will perform a risk assessment for those assets. Vulnerabilities in the information assets are determined in order to enumerate the threats capable of exploiting the assets. The assessment then considers both the probability and impact of a threat exploiting vulnerability in an asset, with impact usually measured in terms of cost to the asset&#39;s stakeholders. The sum of the products of the threats&#39; impact and the probability of their occurring is the total risk to the information asset.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Enterprise Security Management<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>ESM is an emerging market space within the security technology arena that consists of several vendors who provide a holistic view of all your security device information. This includes: consolidating, normalizing, correlating, monitoring, analyzing, reporting on and responding to those security events across multiple heterogeneous security products specifically within mid-size to large Organizations.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>ESM provides the foundation to optimize the enterprise for its intended use, whether in warfare or day-to-day business operations. Providing comprehensive services to manage IA across the enterprise enables operators to tailor the enterprise for the full spectrum of its uses.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Information Security<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The Information Security Management (ISM) framework defines how we manage information security in alignment with the international <a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/resources\/it-security-management-articles\/information-security-management-principles-rar36\" title=\"information security management\">information security management<\/a> standard ISO\/IEC 27001.

Information security management (ISM) describes controls that an organization needs to implement to ensure that it is sensibly managing these risks. An information security management system (ISMS) is a set of policies concerned with information security management or IT related risks. The idioms arose primarily out of ISO 27001.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nFor over twenty years, information security has held confidentiality, integrity and availability to be the core principles of information security.\r\n<h3><strong>IT Security<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\r\n<div>Sometimes referred to as&nbsp;computer security, IT Security is information security when applied to technology (most often some form of computer system). It is worthwhile to note that the computer&nbsp;does not necessarily mean a home desktop. A&nbsp;computer&nbsp;is any device with a&nbsp;processor&nbsp;and some memory (even a calculator). IT security specialists are almost always found in any major enterprise\/establishment due to the nature and value of the data within larger businesses. They are responsible for keeping all of the technology&nbsp;within the company secure from malicious cyber attacks that often attempt to breach into critical private information or gain control of the internal systems.<\/div>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Information Assurance<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\r\n<div>Information Assurance is the act of ensuring that data is not lost when critical issues arise. These issues include but are not limited to&nbsp;natural disasters, computer\/server malfunction, physical theft, or any other instance where&nbsp;data&nbsp;has the potential of being lost. Since most information is stored on&nbsp;computers, information assurance is typically dealt with by IT security specialists. One of the most common methods of providing information assurance is to have an off-site backup of the data in case one of the mentioned issues arise.<\/div>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Similarities<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\r\n<div>The similarities between the Information Security unit, the&nbsp;IT Security unit and the Information Assurance unit is they strive to&nbsp;protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information<\/div>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Differences<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\r\n<div>The difference between them lies under the areas of the way they&nbsp;approach to the subject, the methodologies used, and the areas of concentration<\/div>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Information System Management System<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n\r\n<div>The governing principle behind ISMS is that an organization should design, implement and maintain a coherent set of policies, processes and systems to manage risks to its information assets, thus ensuring acceptable levels of information security risk<br \/>\r\n.<br \/>\r\nThe best known ISMS&nbsp;are described in ISO\/IEC 27001 and ISO\/IEC 27002 and related standards published jointly by ISO and IEC.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAnother competing ISMS&nbsp;is Information Security Forum&#39;s Standard of Good Practice (SOGP).

IPSec is a suite of cryptography-based protection services and security protocols. Because it requires no changes to programs or protocols, you can easily deploy IPSec for existing networks.&nbsp;<\/span><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe driving force for the acceptance and deployment of secure IP is the need for business and government users to connect their private WAN\/ LAN infrastructure to the Internet for providing access to Internet services and use of the Internet as a component of the WAN transport system. As we all know,&nbsp;users need to isolate their networks and at the same time send and receive traffic over the Internet. The authentication and privacy mechanisms of secure IP provide the basis for a security strategy for us.<br \/>\r\nIPsec protects one or more paths between a pair of hosts, a pair of security gateways, or a security gateway and a host. A security gateway is an intermediate device, such as a switch or firewall, that implements IPsec. Devices that use IPsec to protect a path between them are called peers.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nIPsec requires a PCI Accelerator Card (PAC) to provide hardware data compression and encryption. A PAC is a hardware processing unit the switch&rsquo;s CPU controls.<br \/>\r\nIPsec provides the following security services for traffic at the IP layer:\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Data origin authentication&mdash;identifying who sent the data.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Confidentiality (encryption)&mdash;ensuring that the data has not been read en route.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Connectionless integrity&mdash;ensuring the data has not been changed en route.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Replay protection&mdash;detecting packets received more than once to help protect against denial of service attacks.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Applications of IPSec<\/strong><\/h2>\r\nAs we all know to help in the security of a network the Internet community has done lot of work and developed application-specific security mechanisms in numerous application areas, including electronic mail (<em>Privacy Enhanced Mail, Pretty Good Privacy<\/em>&nbsp;[PGP]), network management (<em>Simple Network Management Protocol Version 3<\/em>[SNMPv3]), Web access (Secure HTTP,&nbsp;<em>Secure Sockets Layer<\/em>&nbsp;[SSL]), and others. However, users have some security concerns that cut across protocol layers. For example, an enterprise can run a secure, private TCP\/IP network by disallowing links to untrusted sites, encrypting packets that leave the premises, and authenticating packets that enter the premises. By implementing security at the IP level, an organization can ensure secure networking not only for applications that have security mechanisms but also for the many security-ignorant applications.\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Benefits of IPSec<\/strong><\/h2>\r\nWhen IPSec is implemented in a firewall or router, it provides strong security whose application is to all traffic crossing this perimeter. Traffic within a company or workgroup does not incur the overhead of security-related processing.<br \/>\r\nIPSec is below the transport layer (TCP, UDP), and is thus transparent to applications. There is no need to change software on a user or server system when IPSec is implemented in the firewall or router.<br \/>\r\nEven if IPSec is implemented in end systems, upper layer software, including applications is not affected. IPSec can be transparent to end users.<br \/>\r\nThere is no need to train users on security mechanisms, issue keying material on a per-user basis, or revoke keying material when users leave the organization. IPSec can provide security for individual users if needed. This feature is useful for offsite workers and also for setting up a secure virtual subnetwork within an organization for sensitive applications.\r\n<p><br \/>\r\n&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<hr \/>We provide CISSP training in the following cities:<br \/>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"1\" style=\"width: 150px;\">\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/it-security-management\/cissp-certification-training-san-francisco\/pct2169co34\">SAN FRANCISCO<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t<\/tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/it-security-management\/cissp-certification-training-washington\/pct2141co34\">WASHINGTON<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t<\/tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/it-security-management\/cissp-certification-training-vancouver\/pct2928co34\">VANCOUVER<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t<\/tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/it-security-management\/cissp-certification-training-toronto\/pct2848co34\">TORONTO<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t<\/tr>\r\n\t<\/tbody>\r\n<\/table>","h1Tag":null,"url":"resources\/it-security-management-articles\/understanding-ipsec-rar37","status":"1","image_url":"http:\/\/cfs22.simplicdn.net\/ice9\/free_resources_article_thumb\/11-internet_protocol_security.jpg","created_at":"2012-02-09T00:00:00+00:00","updated_at":null,"infographic_url":null,"thumbnail_url":"NULL","shares":0,"likes":0,"comments":0,"engagement_score":0,"segments":[],"skills":[],"tags":[],"id":"56dfb0f1ac530efd098b457f"},{"course_id":["34"],"type":"article","label_id":"3","vertical":"technology","name":"Understanding IPSec Part II","display_name":"Understanding IPSec Part II","author_name":null,"author_description":null,"author_image":null,"author_linkedin_profile":null,"author_twitter_profile":null,"short_description":"This article is about the different security protocols used by the IPSec","article_content":"<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Security Protocols and Modes<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<div>Given below are the protocols that provide security services:<\/div>\r\n\r\n<div><br \/>\r\nThe <u>Encapsulating Security Payload protocol<\/u> or ESP is a protocol within the IPSec that provides encryption (confidentiality) and authentication (connectionless integrity and data origin authentication). This is done by encrypting and authenticating each IP packet of a communication session.&nbsp;<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe <u>Authentication Header protocol<\/u> or AH is a protocol within the IPSec which provides everything that ESP does like&nbsp;connectionless integrity and data origin authentication,&nbsp;but it does not encrypt to ensure confidentiality. Authentication Header protects an IP packet and also additional headers that AH adds.<br \/>\r\nThese two protocols may be applied alone or together to provide the desired security services. The security they provide depends on the&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/resources\/it-security-management-articles\">cryptographic algorithms&nbsp;<\/a>that are applied. They are algorithm-independent, which lets new algorithms be added without affecting other parts of the implementation.<br \/>\r\nThese protocols also support the two IPsec modes: transport and tunnel.&nbsp;<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe <u>Transport mode<\/u> protects an IP load in upper layer protocols such as User Datagram Protocol and Transmission Control Protocol. AH and ESP intercept packets from the Transport layer that are intended for the network layer, protect the transport header, and provide the configured security. Transport mode provides end-to-end security where the communications endpoint is also the cryptographic endpoint.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<u>Tunnel mode<\/u> protects data by encapsulating entire packets that are &nbsp;de - capsulated by a security gateway.<br \/>\r\nTunnel mode may be used with security gateways where the destination of the packet differs from the security endpoint.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe <u>Opportunistic&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/encryption-and-key-management-rrt3co145vd433-video\">Encryption&nbsp;<\/a><\/u>(OE) refers to any system that, when connecting to another system, attempts to encrypt the communications channel otherwise falling back to unencrypted communications. This method requires no pre-arrangement between the two systems.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe <u>Message Authentication Code<\/u> is a short piece of information that is used to authenticate a message, using an algorithm known as HMAC(keyed-hash message authentication code&nbsp;). HMAC takes as input a portion of the message and a secret key and produces a MAC as output. This MAC value is stored in the Authentication Data field of the AH header. The calculation takes place over the entire enclosed TCP segment plus the authentication header. When this IP packet is received at the destination, the same calculation is performed using the same key. If the calculated MAC equals the value of the received MAC, then the packet is assumed to be authentic.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<u>IPsec NAT-Traversal<\/u> is an enhancement to IPsec and ISAKMP protocols that lets Virtual Private Network (VPN) clients communicate through NAT gateways over the Internet. For example, business travelers commonly use IPsec on their laptops to gain remote VPN access to the central office. When working off-site, these users sometimes need to connect to the Internet through a NAT gateway such as from a hotel. Network Address Translation (NAT) gateways are often part of a company&rsquo;s firewall and let its Local Area Network (LAN) appear as one IP address to the world. For more information about NAT devices, refer to RFC 1631.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<u>Security Associations<\/u>: A key concept that appears in both the authentication and confidentiality mechanisms for IP is the&nbsp;<em>Security Association<\/em>&nbsp;(SA). An association is a one-way relationship between a sender and a receiver that affords security services to the traffic carried on it. If a peer relationship is needed, for two-way secure exchange, then two security associations are required.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<u>Key Management<\/u>: The key management portion of IPSec involves the determination and distribution of secret keys. The&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/security-architecture-rrt3co34vd99-video\">IP Security Architecture<\/a>&nbsp;document mandates support for two types of key management:<\/div>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><em>Manual<\/em>: A system administrator manually configures each system with its own keys and with the keys of other communicating systems. This is practical for small, relatively static environments.<\/li>\r\n\t<li><em>Automated<\/em>: An automated system enables the on-demand creation of keys for SAs and facilitates the use of keys in a large distributed system with an evolving configuration.

They provide the guidelines as to how a company can be directed or controlled such that it can fulfil its goals and objectives in a manner that adds to the value of the company and is also beneficial for all stakeholders in the long term. Stakeholders, in this case, would include everyone ranging from the board of directors, management, shareholders to customers, employees and society. The management of the company hence assumes the role of a trustee for all the others.\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>IT Governance or Information Technology Governance<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/resources\/it-security-management-articles\">Information technology governance<\/a>, however, is a subset discipline of Corporate Governance. Although it is sometimes mistaken as a field of study on its own, IT Governance is actually a part of the overall Corporate Governance Strategy of an organization. In simple words, IT Governance is putting structure around how organizations align IT strategy with business strategy, ensuring that companies stay on track to achieve their strategies and goals, and implementing good ways to measure IT&rsquo;s performance. It makes sure that all stakeholders&rsquo; interests are taken into account and that processes provide measurable results.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAn IT governance framework answers some key questions, such as how the IT department is functioning overall, what key metrics management needs and what return IT is giving back to the business from the investment it&rsquo;s making.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe primary goals of IT Governance are to assure that the investments in IT generate business value, and to mitigate the risks that are associated with IT. This can be done by implementing an organizational structure with well-defined roles for the responsibility of information, business processes, applications and infrastructure.<br \/>\r\nOrganizations and businesses need a structure or framework to ensure that the IT function is able to sustain the organization&rsquo;s strategies and objectives. The framework and level we need depends on the size, industry or applicable laws or regulations. In general, the larger and more regulated the organization, the more detailed the IT governance structure should be.\r\n<h3><strong>IT Governance Framework<\/strong><\/h3>\r\nIt doesn&rsquo;t make sense to reinvent the wheel by starting from scratch. Start with a IT governance framework; there are many to choose from, but using at least one means everything has already been organized by industry experts.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nA IT governance framework includes three elements:\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Governance principles &ndash; the principles by which all IT initiatives will be governed<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Governance structure &ndash; the roles and responsibilities of the major stakeholders in the IT governance decision-making process, including committees and organizational elements at the branch level<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Governance process &ndash; the various stages required to review, assess and approve or reject new IT initiatives<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nImplementing good IT governance requires a framework.\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>COBIT<\/strong><\/h3>\r\nThe framework Control Objectives for Information and related Technologies (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/it-security-management\/cobit-5-foundation-training\">COBIT<\/a>) was developed in 1996, from the Information Systems Audit and Control Association (ISACA), is probably the most popular. Basically, it&rsquo;s a set of guidelines and supporting tool set for IT governance that is accepted worldwide. It&rsquo;s used by auditors and companies as a way to integrate technology to implement controls and meet specific business objectives. COBIT 5 is the only business framework for the governance and management of enterprise IT. This evolutionary version incorporates the latest thinking in enterprise governance and management techniques, and provides globally accepted principles, practices, analytical tools and models to help increase the trust in, and value from, information systems. COBIT 5 builds and expands on COBIT 4.1 by integrating other major frameworks, standards and resources, including ISACA&rsquo;s Val IT and Risk IT, Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) and related standards from the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Certified Information Security Manager CISM<\/strong><\/h3>\r\nThe CISM exam enhances your competitive advantage over other IT security professionals across various industry sectors. This certification is management focused and promotes well-recognized international IT security practices.\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>ITIL<\/strong><\/h3>\r\nThe Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) from the government of the United Kingdom runs a close second to CoBIT. The Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) is a set of practices for <a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/it-service-management\">IT service management (ITSM)<\/a> that focuses on aligning IT services with the needs of business. In its current form (known as ITIL 2011 edition), ITIL is published in a series of five core publications, each of which covers an <a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/lifecycle-and-capability-modules-differentiations-article\">ITSM lifecycle <\/a>stage.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nITIL underpins ISO\/IEC 20000 (previously BS15000), the International Service Management Standard for IT service management, although differences between the two frameworks do exist. ITIL describes processes, procedures, tasks and checklists that are not organization-specific, used by an organization for establishing integration with the organization&#39;s strategy, delivering value and maintaining a minimum level of competency. It allows the organization to establish a baseline from which it can plan, implement, and measure.

It includes guidelines on many functions, including human resource management, inbound and outbound logistics, external resources, information technology, risk, legal affairs, the enterprise, marketing and sales, operations, all financial functions, procurement and reporting. This is a more business-general framework that is less IT-specific than the others.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>CMM<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The Capability Maturity Model Integration method, created by a group from government, industry and Carnegie-Mellon&rsquo;s Software Engineering Institute, is a process improvement approach that contains 22 process areas. It is divided into appraisal, evaluation and structure. CMMI is particularly well-suited to organizations that need help with application development, lifecycle issues and improving the delivery of products throughout the lifecycle. This model became the foundation from which Carnegie Mellon created the Software Engineering Institute (SEI). The term &quot;maturity&quot; relates to the degree of formality and optimization of processes, from ad hoc practices, to formally defined steps, to managed result metrics, to active optimization of the processes.When the model is applied to an existing organization&#39;s software-development processes, it allows an effective approach toward improving them. Eventually it became clear that the model could be applied to other processes. This gave rise to a more general concept that is applied to business.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>ISO 17799<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The International Organization for Standardization has developed the third major governance framework, ISO 17799, titled &ldquo;Information Technology &mdash; Code of Practice for Information Security Management.&rdquo; It was first released by the ISO in December 2000. However, it is based on British Standard 7799, which was finalized in 1999. The intent of the standard is to focus on security and aid an organization in the creation of a IT security plan.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Six Sigma<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Six Sigma at many organizations simply means a measure of quality that strives for near perfection. Six Sigma is a disciplined, data-driven approach and methodology for eliminating defects (driving toward six standard deviations between the mean and the nearest specification limit) in any process &ndash; from manufacturing to transactional and from product to service. Six Sigma&nbsp;is a set of tools and strategies for process improvement originally developed by Motorola in 1986. Six Sigma became well known after Jack Welch&nbsp;made it a central focus of his business strategy at&nbsp;General Electric&nbsp;in 1995, and today it is used in different sectors of industry. The fundamental objective of the Six Sigma methodology is the implementation of a measurement-based strategy that focuses on process improvement and variation reduction through the application of&nbsp;Six Sigma improvement projects. This is accomplished through the use of two Six Sigma sub-methodologies: DMAIC and DMADV.&nbsp; The Six Sigma process requires 99.99967% error free processes and products, (or 3.4 parts per million defects or less). Six Sigma processes resulted in $16&ndash;17 billion in savings to Motorola as of 2006.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>The&nbsp;balanced scorecard&nbsp;(BSC)<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The balanced scorecard is a strategic planning and management system&nbsp;used to align business activities to the vision and strategy of the organization, improve internal and external communications, and monitor organizational performance against strategic goals.&nbsp;It is perhaps the best known of several such frameworks (it is the most widely adopted performance management framework reported in the annual survey of management tools undertaken by&nbsp;Bain &amp; Company,&nbsp;and has been widely adopted in English-speaking western countries and Scandinavia in the early 1990s).<\/p>","h1Tag":null,"url":"resources\/it-security-management-articles\/it-governance-rar40","status":"1","image_url":"http:\/\/cfs22.simplicdn.net\/ice9\/free_resources_article_thumb\/freeresources_517e5d92509a9.jpg","created_at":"2012-03-19T00:00:00+00:00","updated_at":null,"infographic_url":null,"thumbnail_url":"NULL","shares":0,"likes":0,"comments":0,"engagement_score":0,"segments":[],"skills":[],"tags":[],"id":"56dfb0f1ac530efd098b4582"},{"course_id":["249"],"type":"article","label_id":"3","vertical":"technology","name":"Understanding JVM and the Implications of Sandbox Model","display_name":"Understanding JVM and the Implications of Sandbox Model","author_name":null,"author_description":null,"author_image":null,"author_linkedin_profile":null,"author_twitter_profile":null,"short_description":"Java is a technology from Oracle (formerly: Sun Microsystems.)

Java&nbsp;can be defined as a&nbsp;general-purpose,&nbsp;concurrent,&nbsp;class-based,&nbsp;object-oriented&nbsp;computer programming language&nbsp;that is specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. This language is intended to let application developers &quot;write once, run anywhere&quot; (WORA), meaning that code that runs on one platform does not need to be recompiled to run on another. This means that the Java applications are typically&nbsp;compiled&nbsp;to&nbsp;bytecode&nbsp;(class file) that can run on any&nbsp;Java virtual machine&nbsp;(JVM) regardless of&nbsp;computer architecture.\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Introduction<\/strong><\/h3>\r\nIn Java language\/platform one of the main design considerations is to provide a secure environment for executing mobile code. Java language is widely used and has its own unique set of security challenges. With the help of the Java security architecture&nbsp;we can protect users and systems from hostile programs downloaded over a network, it cannot defend against implementation bugs that occur in&nbsp;<em>trusted<\/em>&nbsp;code. The &nbsp;bugs in our code can inadvertently open the very holes that the security architecture was designed to contain, including access to files, printers, webcams, microphones, and the network from behind firewalls. In severe cases local programs may be executed or Java security disabled. These bugs can potentially be used to turn the machine into a zombie computer, steal confidential data from machine and intranet, spy through attached devices, prevent useful operation of the machine, assist further attacks, and many other malicious activities. The choice of language system impacts the robustness of any software program. The Java language&nbsp;and virtual machine&nbsp;provides us with many features to mitigate common programming mistakes.\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Java Security<\/strong><\/h3>\r\nIn today&rsquo;s world hacking is done for both ethical and unethical reasons. A lot of security professionals and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/types-of-hackers-article\">hackers<\/a> are permanently trying to break out each security system, and they use more and more sophisticated ideas, approaches and tools. So software systems producers have also to improve their products permanently, and make them more reliable, secure and proof to different kinds of attacks.<br \/>\r\nThe Java platform was designed keeping in mind security. As we know at its core, the Java language itself is type-safe and provides automatic garbage collection, enhancing the robustness of application code. A secure class loading and verification mechanism ensures that only legitimate Java code is executed. Java programs and libraries check for illegal state at the earliest opportunity. These features also make Java programs immune to the stack-smashing&nbsp;and buffer overflow attacks possible in the C and to a lesser extent C++ programming languages. These attacks have been described as the single most pernicious problem in computer security today. The explicit static typing of Java makes code easy to understand and the dynamic checks ensure unexpected conditions result in predictable behavior -- which makes Java a joy to use.\r\n<h3><strong>Java Security at Language Level<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Security in Java is enforced through a number of mechanisms. We can see Java Security implemented via basic language features:<br \/>\r\nJava is simplified and easy to use. If we compare Java with other languages like C++ it is much simpler.&nbsp; Java is strictly object-oriented. In Java we know the wrapper classes defined even for the simple data types, and there can be no structures outside classes. Thus all security-related advantages of the object-oriented paradigm can be used. Java has Final classes and methods. In Java Language Security this feature disallows sub-classing when applied to class definitions and disallows overriding when applied to method definitions, and prevents the undesired modification of certain functionality. We know that Java is a strongly typed language. Polymorphism is a very powerful object-oriented feature, but it holds potential risks of masking hostile objects. Both the compiler and the runtime checking disallow such possibilities, because no assignment can be made if object types are incompatible. One of the features we know in Java language is automated memory management with no direct use of pointers and address arithmetic. Availability of this feature disallows incorrect memory access and minimizes the probability of memory leaks, unauthorized data access and runtime crashes.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nPlease visit Simplilearn&#39;s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/web-app-and-programming\/java-development-training\" title=\"Java Development Certification Training\">Java Development Certification Training<\/a> &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<hr \/>We provide <a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/it-security-management\/cobit-5-foundation-training\">COBIT Certification<\/a> Foundation training in the following cities:<br \/>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"1\" style=\"width: 300px;\">\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/it-security-management\/cobit-5-foundation-training-bangalore\/pct47co35\">BANGALORE<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/it-security-management\/cobit-5-foundation-training-hyderabad\/pct46co35\">HYDERABAD<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t<\/tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/it-security-management\/cobit-5-foundation-training-mumbai\/pct45co35\">MUMBAI<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td><span style=\"line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 11pt; mso-ascii-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-hansi-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-bidi; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/it-security-management\/cobit-5-foundation-training-dubai\/pct489co35\">DUBAI<\/a><\/span><\/td>\r\n\t\t<\/tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/it-security-management\/cobit-5-foundation-training-chennai\/pct27co35\">CHENNAI<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>&nbsp;<\/td>\r\n\t\t<\/tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/it-security-management\/cobit-5-foundation-training-delhi\/pct66co35\">DELHI<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>&nbsp;<\/td>\r\n\t\t<\/tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/it-security-management\/cobit-5-foundation-training-pune\/pct55co35\">PUNE<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>&nbsp;<\/td>\r\n\t\t<\/tr>\r\n\t<\/tbody>\r\n<\/table>","h1Tag":null,"url":"resources\/it-security-management-articles\/understanding-java-security-rar41","status":"1","image_url":"http:\/\/cfs22.simplicdn.net\/ice9\/free_resources_article_thumb\/freeresources_517e5de19f3b3.jpg","created_at":"2012-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","updated_at":null,"infographic_url":null,"thumbnail_url":"NULL","shares":0,"likes":0,"comments":0,"engagement_score":0,"segments":[],"skills":[],"tags":[],"id":"56dfb0f1ac530efd098b4583"},{"course_id":["249"],"type":"article","label_id":"3","vertical":"technology","name":"Java Security - Byte code Authentication and Model Elucidation","display_name":"Java Security - Byte code Authentication and Model Elucidation","author_name":"Chandana","author_description":"Chandana is working as a Senior Content Writer in Simplilearn.com and handles variety of creative writing jobs.

This bytecode is the same no matter what hardware or operating system the program is running under. There is a JIT (Just In Time) compiler within the&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/jvm-and-the-implications-of-sandbox-model-rar41-article\">Java Virtual Machine<\/a>, or JVM. The JIT compiler translates the Java bytecode into native processor instructions at run-time and caches the native code in memory during execution. The Java Virtual Machine is responsible for the execution of Java programs, and also for the implementation of a very important part of the Java Security features:<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nJava compilers produce platform-independent bytecode, executed by the Java Virtual Machine. Compilers and a bytecode verifier ensure that only legitimate Java bytecodes are executed. The bytecode verifier, together with the Java Virtual Machine, guarantees language safety at run time.The Class Loader finds and loads the byte codes for the class definitions. Once loaded, they are verified before the creation of actual classes. The Class Loader also ensures that the JVM isn&#39;t tricked into using false representations of the core class libraries-ones that could break the Java security model.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nCheck out Simplilearn&#39;s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/web-app-and-programming\/java-development-training\">Java Development training<\/a>.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nFinally, the Class Loader provides separate name spaces for classes loaded from different locations, which prevents untrusted classes to interfere with the running of other programs.Runtime safety checks. Because of the late binding provided by the JVM, additional late (runtime) type checking is done of assignments and array bounds. Thus the JVM ensures that only properly assignable operations are performed, and no access outside correct array bounds can be realized.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nWe know that running JVM has at most has one Security Manager installed. The SecurityManager checks in advance every statement and restricts the actions of a piece of untrusted code to the bare minimum. Access Controller and permissions. Application programs cannot install their own Security Managers, but it is possible to give them individual permissions to very specific operations using the policy tool program. With the Access Controller class the programmer can check if the user has permission to perform a given operation.&nbsp; The software implementation of the JVM security features is known as &quot;sandbox&quot; in which Java programs can run safely, without potential risk to systems or users. This sandbox evolved seriously since its first version.\r\n<p><strong>Sandbox Model for Java Security<\/strong><\/p>\r\nThe Java 2 Platform sandbox model introduced the capabilities to enhance security to very finely control access and implemented a new philosophy: applications run with different permissions, no built-in notion of trusted code. The Java 2 Platform sandbox ensures:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Dynamic, extensible security model;<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Fine-grained access control to protect resources;<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Easily configurable security policy enforced by security manager;<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Easily extensible access control structure;<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Extension of security checks to all Java programs, including applications as well as applets.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;Java Cryptography Architecture (JCA)<\/strong><\/p>\r\n&nbsp;Java Cryptography Architecture is defined as a framework for providing cryptographic capabilities to Java programs. This framework provides support for message digests, key pairs management, digital signatures and certificates. MVC (Model-View-Controller) model is used in the design of this framework, which separates concepts from implementation. The implementation part is delivered from the security provider.\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Applets<\/strong><\/p>\r\nWeb Applets are one of the most exciting uses of the Java Platform. Applets are small pieces of executable code which may be included in Web pages and which runs inside of the user&rsquo;s browser. While traditional web pages have been limited to simple text and graphics, applets allow web publishers to include sophisticated, interactive applications in their pages. For example, a stock broker might want to publish the results of a financial analysis model. With applets, instead of publishing a simple graph showing the results of the model, the broker could publish the model itself, along with connections to live stock market data and the customer&rsquo;s portfolio.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nJava protects its users from these dangers by placing strict limits on applets. Applets cannot read from or write to the local disk. Stand-alone windows created by applets are clearly labeled as being owned by untrusted software. These limits prevent malicious applets from stealing information,<br \/>\r\nspreading viruses, or acting as Trojan horses. Applets are also prohibited from making network connections to other computers on the corporate intranet. This prevents malicious applets from exploiting security flaws that might exist behind the firewall or in the underlying operating system.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nSince digital signatures allow us to assign to Java applets the same level of trust which we assign to shrinkwrapped applications, it may be useful to relax the Java security restrictions for some applets.\r\n<p><strong>Auditing<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Auditing is another important security feature.

Management tools such as information classification, risk assessment and risk analysis are used to identify threats, classify assets and to rate system vulnerabilities so that effective control can be implemented.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Organizational Security Model or Framework<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Organizational security model is a framework which is made of many components (logical, physical and administrative), procedures, processes and configurations that all work together to provide security level for the given system.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Information security or InfoSec<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Infosec as it is known popularly is the term used to define the practice to protect the information from illegal access, use, disclosure, disruption, change, perusal, inspection, recording or destruction. This is a standard term that is used regardless of the form the data may take.<br \/>\r\nThe following are the typical terms that we will hear when dealing with information security:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>IT Security or Computer Security<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>IT Security, also known as Computer Security is defined as information security when applied to technology (Hardware and Software). We define a computer as any device or hardware with a processor and memory. IT security specialists are present in almost all major enterprise\/ establishments due to the nature and value of the data within larger businesses. The IT security team is responsible for keeping all of the technology within the company secure from malicious cyber attacks that often attempt to breach into critical private information or gain control of the internal systems.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Information Assurance<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Information Assurance (IA) is the act of ensuring that data is not lost when grave issues arise. The issues which can be reason for loss of data can include but are not limited to the natural disasters, computer problem or error, physical theft of the hardware or software, or any other issue where data has the potential of being lost. Information assurance includes protection of the integrity, availability, authenticity, non-repudiation and confidentiality of the application and user data. It uses physical, technical and administrative controls to accomplish these tasks. While focused predominantly on information in digital form, the full range of IA encompasses not only digital but also analog or physical form. These protections apply to data in transit, both physical and electronic forms as well as data at rest in various types of physical and electronic storage facilities. Information assurance as a field has grown from the practice of information security.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Certified Information Systems Auditor (CISA)<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/it-security-management\/cisa-certification-training\">CISA certification<\/a> is meant for Information Technology professionals specifically in audit arena sponsored by ISACA, formerly the Information Systems Audit and Control Association. This particular certification is planned for those who audit, control, monitor and review an enterprise&rsquo;s information technology and business systems. Candidates for the certification must meet requirements set by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/resources\/it-security-management-articles\">ISACA<\/a> on educational qualification and professional experience.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Security policy<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/resources\/it-security-management-articles\">Security policy<\/a> is the term used to describe as what it means to be a secure system, organization or component or entity. This policy addresses the constraints on actions taken by its members as well as constraints imposed on adversaries. Security policy for the given systems is the mechanism to address constraints on functions and flow among them, constraints on access by external systems and adversaries including programs and access to data by people.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>IT Security Incident Management<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>IT Security Incident Management can be defined as a process which tells us on the effectiveness of preparation by our information technology (IT) department or administrator to handle security incidents. In our experience many organizations will only learn to respond to security incidents after suffering attacks. After attack, incidents often become much more costly than needed. Proper incident response should be an integral part of the organization&#39;s overall security policy and risk mitigation strategy.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Network Security<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Network security is the term often used for the requirements and policies adopted by a network team to prevent and monitor unauthorized access, misuse, modification, or denial of a computer network service or resource.<br \/>\r\nNetwork security involves the authorization of access to data in a network, which is controlled by the network administrator. Users are assigned a Used ID and password or it could be any other information to authenticate and access to information and programs they are authorized to access. Network security covers a variety of computer networks, both public and private, that are used in everyday jobs conducting transactions and communications among businesses, government agencies and individuals. Networks can be private, such as within a company, and others which might be open to public access. Network security is involved in organizations, enterprises, and other types of institutions. It does as its title explains: It secures the network, as well as protecting and overseeing operations being done. The most common and simple way of protecting a network resource is by assigning it a unique name and a corresponding password.<\/p>","h1Tag":"Security Risk Management","url":"resources\/it-security-management-articles\/security-risk-management-rar43","status":"1","image_url":"http:\/\/cfs22.simplicdn.net\/ice9\/free_resources_article_thumb\/freeresources_517e64a433f5b.jpg","created_at":"2012-04-27T00:00:00+00:00","updated_at":null,"infographic_url":null,"thumbnail_url":"NULL","shares":0,"likes":0,"comments":0,"engagement_score":0,"segments":[],"skills":[],"tags":[],"id":"56dfb0f1ac530efd098b4585"},{"course_id":[],"type":"article","label_id":"3","vertical":null,"name":"Reassessing the Concepts of Security Risk Management","display_name":"Reassessing the Concepts of Security Risk Management","author_name":"Chandana","author_description":"Chandana is working as a Senior Content Writer in Simplilearn.com and handles variety of creative writing jobs.

Applications only control the use of resources granted to them, and not which resources are granted to them. The real protection happens at the core of the problem i.e. by implementing proper application software development and coding practices.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) and Web Application Security Consortium (WASC) updates on the latest threats which impair web based applications. This aids developers, security testers and architects to focus on better design and mitigation strategy.

The act of accessing may mean consuming, entering, or using. Permission to access a resource is called authorization. Access is the flow of information between a subject and&nbsp;an object. A subject is an active entity and an object is a passive entity.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Authentication<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Authentication is to verify identity of a subject that is requesting the use of a system. The authentication process involves confirming the identity of a person or software program, tracing the origins of an artifact, or ensuring that a product is what its packaging and labeling claims to be. This process often involves verifying the validity of at least one form of identification.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Cryptography<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Cryptography is the science and practice of secret writing and study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of adversaries. This practice is about constructing and analyzing protocols that overcome the influence of adversaries and which are related to various aspects in information security such as data confidentiality, data integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation. Modern cryptography intersects the disciplines of mathematics, computer science, and electrical engineering.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Cyber Security<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Cyber security standards are security standards which enable organizations to practice safe security techniques to minimize the number of successful <a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/cyber-threats-article\" title=\"Cyber security attacks\">cyber security attacks<\/a>. These guides provide general outlines as well as specific techniques for implementing cyber security. For certain specific standards, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/it-security-management\/ceh-certification-kolkata\/pct54co105\" title=\"Cyber security certification\">cyber security certification<\/a> by an accredited body can be obtained. There are many advantages to obtaining certification including the ability to get cyber security insurance.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>IT Risk<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Risk in the context of security is the possibility of damage happening and ramifications of such damage if it occurs. IT risk or IT-related risk can be considered as any risk in the IT or related industry. The term IT risk is comparatively new term and this owes to an increasing awareness that information security is simply one facet of a large amount of risks that are relevant to IT industry and the IT processes it supports. We can say that risk is the product of the likelihood of an event occurring and the impact that event would have on an IT asset, i.e. Risk = Likelihood * Impact.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Further, the impact of an event on an information asset is usually taken to be the product of a vulnerability in the asset and the asset&#39;s value to its stakeholders. Thus, IT risk can be expanded to:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Total Risk = Threat * Vulnerability * Asset Value<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Further this can be defined as&nbsp;the potential that a given&nbsp;threat&nbsp;will exploit&nbsp;vulnerabilities&nbsp;of an&nbsp;asset&nbsp;or group of assets and thereby cause harm to the organization. It is measured in terms of a combination of the probability of occurrence of an event and its consequence.<\/p>","h1Tag":null,"url":"resources\/it-security-management-articles\/security-risk-management-rar44","status":"1","image_url":"http:\/\/cfs22.simplicdn.net\/ice9\/free_resources_article_thumb\/freeresources_517e64e1b60b0.jpg","created_at":"2012-05-10T00:00:00+00:00","updated_at":null,"infographic_url":null,"thumbnail_url":"NULL","shares":0,"likes":0,"comments":0,"engagement_score":0,"segments":[],"skills":[],"tags":[],"id":"56dfb0f1ac530efd098b4586"},{"course_id":[],"type":"article","label_id":"3","vertical":null,"name":"Understanding Secure Electronic Transaction","display_name":"Understanding Secure Electronic Transaction","author_name":null,"author_description":null,"author_image":null,"author_linkedin_profile":null,"author_twitter_profile":null,"short_description":null,"article_content":"<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Secure Electronic Transaction (SET)<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The secure electronic transaction (SET) protocol is the protocol used to facilitate the secure transmission of consumer credit card information over insecure&nbsp;networks, such as the Internet. SET blocks out the details of credit card information, thus preventing merchants, hackers and electronic thieves from accessing this information. SET was developed by&nbsp;SETco, led by&nbsp;VISA&nbsp;and&nbsp;MasterCard&nbsp; starting in 1996. SET was based on&nbsp;X.509&nbsp;certificates with several extensions. The first version was finalised in May 1997 and a pilot test was announced in July 1998.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>SET makes use of Netscape&#39;s Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), Microsoft&#39;s Secure Transaction Technology (STT), and Secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol (S-HTTP). SET uses some but not all aspects of a public key infrastructure (PKI).SET allowed parties to identify themselves to each other and exchange information securely. SET used a&nbsp;cryptographic blinding algorithm&nbsp;that, in effect, would have let merchants substitute a certificate for a user&#39;s credit-card number.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Key Features of SET<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Confidentiality of Information:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the context of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/it-security-management\">IT Security Management<\/a>, confidentiality of the information is one of the important aspects of SET. Here cardholder account and payment information is secured as it moves across the network. An interesting and important feature of SET is that it prevents the merchant from learning the cardholder&rsquo;s credit card number; this is only provided to the issuing bank. The conventional encryption by DES is used to provide confidentiality.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Integrity of Data<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Integrity of data is achieved by SET protocol. Payment information sent from cardholders to merchants includes order information, personal data, and payment instructions. SET guarantees that these message contents are not altered in transit. RSA digital signatures, using SHA-1 hash codes, provide message integrity. Certain messages are also protected by HMAC using SHA-1.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Cardholder Account Authentication<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>To authenticate cardholders SET enables merchants to verify that a cardholder is a legitimate user of a valid card account number. SET uses X.509v3 digital certificates with RSA signatures for this purpose.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Merchant Authentication<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>SET also helps in authenticating Merchants. SET enables cardholders to verify that a merchant has a relationship with a financial institution allowing it to accept payment cards. SET uses X.509v3 digital certificates with RSA signatures for this purpose.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Dual Signature<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>An important innovation introduced in SET is the dual signature. We use dual signature for the same purpose as we use standard electronic signature: to guarantee the authentication and integrity of data. It links two messages that are intended for two different recipients. In this case, the customer wants to send the order information (OI) to the merchant and the payment information (PI) to the bank. The merchant does not need to know the customer&#39;s credit card number, and the bank does not need to know the details of the customer&#39;s order. The link is needed so that the customer can prove that the payment is intended for this order.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>SET Participants<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The following are&nbsp;&nbsp; the participants in the SET system:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Cardholder Acquirer<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Merchant<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Issuer<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Acquirer<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Certificate Authority<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Cardholder<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;In the electronic environment, consumers and corporate purchasers interact with merchants from personal computers over the Internet. A cardholder is an authorized holder of a payment card that has been issued by an issuer.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Merchant<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A merchant is a person or organization that has goods and services to sell to the cardholder. Typically, these goods and services are offered via a Web site or by electronic mail. A merchant that accepts payment cards must have a relationship with an acquirer.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>&nbsp;Issuer<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This is a financial institution, such as a bank, that provides the cardholder with the payment card.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Acquirer<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This is a financial institution that establishes an account with a merchant and processes payment card authorizations and payments. Merchants will usually accept more that one credit card brand but do not want to deal with multiple bankcard associations or with multiple individual issuers. The acquirer provides authorization to the merchant that a given card account is active and that the proposed purchase does not exceed the credit limit. The acquirer also provides electronic transfer of payments to the merchant&rsquo;s account.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Certification Authority (CA)<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This is an entity that is trusted to issue X509v3 <a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/resources\/it-security-management-articles\/digital-certificates-rar218\">public-key certificates <\/a>for cardholders, merchants, and payment gateways. The success of SET will depend on the existence of a CA infrastructure available for this purpose.<\/p>\r\n","h1Tag":null,"url":"resources\/it-security-management-articles\/understanding-secure-electronic-transaction-rar45","status":null,"image_url":"http:\/\/cfs22.simplicdn.net\/ice9\/free_resources_article_thumb\/freeresources_517e6080b5037.jpg","created_at":"2016-03-09T05:13:21+00:00","updated_at":null,"infographic_url":null,"thumbnail_url":"NULL","shares":0,"likes":0,"comments":0,"engagement_score":0,"segments":[],"skills":[],"tags":[],"id":"56dfb0f1ac530efd098b4587"},{"course_id":[],"type":"article","label_id":"3","vertical":null,"name":"Understanding Secure Electronic Transaction","display_name":"Understanding Secure Electronic Transaction","author_name":null,"author_description":null,"author_image":null,"author_linkedin_profile":null,"author_twitter_profile":null,"short_description":null,"article_content":"<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Understanding Secure Electronic Transaction Part-II<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Cryptography<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This is interesting that <a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/resources\/it-security-management-articles\/understanding-secure-electronic-transaction-rar45\">SET <\/a>mainly uses cryptography to meet its objectives. Hence, we shall digress briefly to discuss some basics about cryptography. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/resources\/it-security-management\/classic-cryptographic-algorithms\">Cryptography <\/a>is the science of encrypting messages, that is, converting clear text to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/resources\/it-security-management-articles\/cryptography-rar216\">cipher text <\/a>using an algorithm, and then converting it back from cipher text to clear text using the same or another algorithm. There are two common encryption methods: secret key cryptography and public key cryptography (PKC).<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>If we look at the history, secret key cryptography (also called symmetric key or single key cryptography) has been around for a long time and hence its use is widespread. The most popular implementation is DES, which is used by all financial institutions to encrypt debit and credit card transactions. The sender uses a single 56-bit key (also called a symmetric key) to encrypt information and the receiver will use the same key to decrypt. We have well-developed hardware and software implementations which encrypt and decrypt using DES at very high speeds.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>A much more secure and sophisticated <a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/resources\/virtualization-and-cloud-computing-videos\/encryption-and-key-management-rrt3co145vd433\">encryption <\/a>method is public key cryptography (PKC), also known as asymmetric key cryptography, which uses two keys. Any one key (it does not matter which) can be used to encrypt and the other can be used to decrypt. This fundamental property lies at the core of SET. However, encryption and decryption are relatively slow using PKC.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Secure Transmission Using PKC1<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>When two users want to exchange messages securely, each of them transmits one component of their key pair, designated the public key, to the other and keeps secret the other component, designated the private key. Because messages encrypted with the public key can only be decrypted using the private key, these messages can be transmitted over an insecure network without fear that an eavesdropper could use the key to read encrypted transmissions.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, Bob can transmit a confidential message to Alice by encrypting the message using Alice&#39;s public key. As long as Alice ensures that no one else has access to her private key, both she and Bob will know that only Alice can read the message.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Cryptographic Blinding Algorithm<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In cryptography, blinding is a technique by which an agent can provide a service to (i.e., compute a function for) a client in an encoded form without knowing either the real input or the real output. Blinding techniques also have applications to preventing side-channel attacks on encryption devices.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most common application of blinding is the&nbsp;blind signature. In a blind signature protocol, the signer digitally signs a message without being able to learn its content.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The&nbsp;OTP&nbsp;is an application of blinding to the secure communication problem, by its very nature. Alice would like to send a message to Bob secretly, however all of their communication can be read by Oscar. Therefore Alice sends the message after blinding it with a secret key or OTP that she shares with Bob. Bob reverses the blinding after receiving the message. In this example, the function&nbsp;f&nbsp;is the&nbsp;identity&nbsp;and&nbsp;E&nbsp;and&nbsp;D&nbsp;are both typically the&nbsp;XOR&nbsp;operation.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Conclusion<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We can conclude and summarize that SET is a protocol which enables highly secure Internet shopping using credit cards. It has been developed by Visa and MasterCard in response to the security concerns of transacting on the Internet. The explosive growth of transactions on the Internet will only be further fuelled by SET. The SET protocol itself is still evolving, and is presently being extended to cover debit card transactions as well.<\/p>\r\n","h1Tag":null,"url":"resources\/it-security-management-articles\/understanding-secure-electronic-transaction-rar46","status":null,"image_url":"http:\/\/cfs22.simplicdn.net\/ice9\/free_resources_article_thumb\/freeresources_517e6080b5037.jpg","created_at":"2016-03-09T05:13:21+00:00","updated_at":null,"infographic_url":null,"thumbnail_url":"NULL","shares":0,"likes":0,"comments":0,"engagement_score":0,"segments":[],"skills":[],"tags":[],"id":"56dfb0f1ac530efd098b4588"},{"course_id":[],"type":"article","label_id":"3","vertical":null,"name":"Steganography \u2013 Chrominance Components and Algorithm Improvements","display_name":"Steganography \u2013 Chrominance Components and Algorithm Improvements","author_name":null,"author_description":null,"author_image":null,"author_linkedin_profile":null,"author_twitter_profile":null,"short_description":null,"article_content":"<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Understanding Steganography<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Steganography is the science of hiding information by embedding the hidden message within a cover media (for example, an image, audio or video carrier file) in such a way that the hidden information cannot be easily perceived to exist for the unintended recipients of the cover media. The message is not encrypted, just hidden. Steganography is kind of security through obscurity.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>In <a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/resources\/it-security-management-articles\/understanding-steganography-rar48\" title=\"digital steganography\">digital steganography<\/a>, there is a possibility of coding inside the document file ,image file etc. Media files are ideal for steganographic transmission.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first recorded uses of steganography can be traced back to 440 BC when Herodotus mentions two examples of steganography in his Histories.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Components of Steganography<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<h4>Carrier<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>A data stream or a file system that has hidden message inside it.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Stego Medium<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>This is the medium used to hide information.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Payload<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>This is the message or information that needs to be hidden.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Steganographic System<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The choice of embedding algorithm in the most cases is driven by the results of the steganographic channel robustness analysis . One of the areas that improves steganographic robustness is usage of a key scheme for embedding messages. Various key steganographic schemes have various levels of protection. Key scheme term means a procedure of how to use key steganographic system based on the extent of its use. However, when the steganographic robustness is increased a bandwidth of the whole embedding system is decreased. Therefore the task of a scheme selection for achieving the optimal values of the steganographic system is not trivial.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Embedding messages in steganographic system can be carried out without use of a key or with use of a key. To improve steganographic robustness key can be used as a verification option. It can make an impact on the distribution of bits of a message within a container, as well as an impact on the procedure of forming a sequence of embedded bits of a message.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Information Hiding in Noisy Data<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The cover media (images or digital sound) typically has redundancies in the form of a noise component (i.e., insignificant parts) and the general principle underlying most steganographic methods is to place the secret message in the noise component of the signal.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The cover can be typically considered as a sequence of bits. In the case of a digital sound, this sequence is the sequence of samples over time. In the case of a digital image, a sequence can be obtained by vectorizing the image (i.e., by lining up the gray-scale or color values in a left-to-right and top-to-bottom order).<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>A simple way to hide information in a sequence of binary numbers (bytes) is to replace the least significant bit (LSB) of each byte with a bit of the secret message or replace the LSB of bytes according to a sequence of pseudo random numbers generated at both sides.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>For better security, the embedding algorithm should not significantly alter the statistical profile of the cover.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Types of Steganography<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<h4>Pure Steganography<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Pure Steganography does not require the prior exchange of any secret information (for example, the stego-key).In this case, the size of the cover should be at least the size of the message to be hidden. Both sender and receiver should have access to the embedding and extraction algorithms, but the algorithms should not be public. Pure Steganography is equivalent to the notion of &ldquo;security-by-obscurity&rdquo; since we assume the opponent does not know the embedding\/ extraction algorithms in use. However, pure steganography is not very secure in practice as opponents often have a list of embedding\/ extraction algorithms that could be used and could subject the captured media to rigorous steganalysis (attempts to extract the hidden information from a stego media).Here the receiver cannot easily distinguish whether the message came from the actual sender or a malicious intruder.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Secret Key Steganography<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>In Secret Key Steganography the sender chooses a cover and embeds the secret message into the cover using a secret key known only to the sender and receiver. The receiver can only extract the hidden message if he knows the secret key. Anyone who does not know the secret key should not be able to obtain evidence of the encoded information. The cover and the stego-objects can be perceptually similar.

Their paper proposed two methods of hiding data: in a series of fixed size files originally consisting of random bits on top of which &#39;vectors&#39; could be superimposed in such a way as to allow levels of security to decrypt all lower levels but not even know of the existence of any higher levels, or an entire partition is filled with random bits and files hidden in it.<\/div>\r\n\r\n<p>A steganographic file system must meet three basic requirements.&nbsp; First, like any file system, it must be able to manage the storage of files on a disk.&nbsp; Second, it must provide a mechanism for hiding files.&nbsp; This allows a user to plausibly deny the number of files stored on disk.&nbsp; Third, it must provide a mechanism for accessing files that have been hidden.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Steganograpy of VoIP Streams<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) streams, are broadcasted live over the Internet and delivered to end-users. Security remains one of the main challenges with this new technology. With the upsurge of VoIP applications available for use in recent years, VoIP streams become one of the most &nbsp;interesting cover objects for modern steganography. Digital steganography in low bit rate audio streams is commonly regarded as a challenging topic in the field of data hiding.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>BPCS Steganography (Bit-Plane Complexity Segmentation Steganography)<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>BPCS Steganography is a type of digital steganography. Digital steganography can hide confidential data very securely by embedding them into some media data (vessel data). In BPCS Steganography true color images (i.e., 24-bit color images) are mostly used for vessel data. The embedding operation in practice is to replace the &quot;complex areas&quot; on the bit planes of the vessel image with the confidential data. The most important aspect of this type of steganography is that the embedding capacity is very large.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Steganalysis<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Steganalysis is the art and science of detecting messages hidden using steganography; this is analogous to cryptanalysis applied to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/resources\/it-security-management-articles\/cryptography-rar216\">cryptography<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Hiding Model and Algorithm<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Steganography takes advantage of the redundancy of data in the cover media to insert the &ldquo;extra&rdquo; information so that there could be no perceptible change to the cover media.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"steganography embedding algorithm\" title=\"steganography embedding algorithm\" src=\"http:\/\/cfs22.simplicdn.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/steganography-embedding-algorithm.png\" style=\"width: 602px; height: 301px;\" \/><\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Extraction Model and Algorithm<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The extraction process should be possible without the cover.

The first step should be to evaluate the purpose and then decide on, which option is the most appropriate.<br \/>\r\nThe three different aspects of Change Management include: Versatility, controlling the change, and affecting the change.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<strong>Versatility<\/strong> is one of the very important aspects. This means that you need to select software which has the capability to run on various platforms. This will allow a greater flexibility and ease of operation.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAn enthusiastic approach to deal with changes is at the core of all three aspects i.e. Versatility, controlling the change, and affecting the change. For an organization, change management is defining, describing and implementing technologies or procedures in order to deal with the changes in business and surely to gain profit from the changing opportunities.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nA Successful adaptation to change is as important in a business organization as it is in nature, like plants and animals, individuals and organizations inevitably face changes and they don&rsquo;t have a control over these changes. If we are able to deal with the change successfully, the success is inevitable.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAdaptation no doubt involves establishing an organized methodology for responding to changes in the business environment or else we can establish the coping mechanisms like new technologies or policies, so that we can respond to changes in the workplace successfully.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThere is an entity which initiates a change and that major entity is known as the <strong>Request -for-Change (RFC)<\/strong>.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>What is a change request?<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>RFC is a formal communication asking for a modification, addition and removal or deregistration to base-lined (CI) s Configuration Item(s). It is very important to define changes on a broad spectrum a closed approach for defining change is not effective at all. We surely need many templates to cover up different types, areas and flavors of change. It is important that a RFC (change request) should be very descriptive about the change details like the purpose, impacts on other CIs and risks.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe <a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/it-service-management\/itil-foundation-training\">ITIL version 3<\/a> defines three types of changes i.e. normal change, standard change and emergency change.<br \/>\r\nITIL defines a <strong>normal change<\/strong> as a change which should follow the complete change management process; it will go through all the steps of change management and at the end will be reviewed by the CAB (change advisory board)<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>The ITIL description of a Standard Change is;<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>An infrastructural change which is recurrent and follows a conventional path, and has got a pre-defined procedure or solution to a specific requirement or set of requirements, thereby making <a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/it-service-management\/itil-expert-certification-training\">ITIL Expert certification<\/a> one of the most sought after credential.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<strong>Emergency changes<\/strong>, as the name itself suggest that it has got no pre-defined path to follow neither it will go through the complete change management process.

It provides a very practical and realistic framework for identifying, strategizing, delivering and supporting IT services to the business.<br \/>\r\nITIL has been adopted and applied by a number of organizations all over the world, one great example can be NASA; organizations like the UK National Health Service (NHS) and Disney also follow the ITIL path<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Why we should have ITIL trained staff<\/strong>?<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>When an organization launches a new technology or initiative, companies spend lavishly and we have seen millions of bucks being spent on the infrastructure. Fancy buildings and hi-tech software packages can only help as an eye candy for the outer world. But one thing that almost every management is very prone to forget and managers reluctant to offer is an adequately trained staff. New technology or infrastructure is not of much use if we don&rsquo;t have skilled enough people. If we don&rsquo;t have the newest technology or fancy infrastructure, we can still manage if we have skilled people around. But if we have everything else but not proper skill to handle all new technologies, there are fair chances of reaching nowhere.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nGetting our staff adequately trained is one sure step towards success and ITIL is one the best choices.<br \/>\r\n<strong>If we are talking about ITIL, it is very important to dig deep into the term ITSM (IT service management). IT Service management training<\/strong>&nbsp;is a process-based procedure, the main aim of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/it-service-management\/itsm-certification-training\" title=\"ITSM certification\">ITSM certification<\/a> is to align the delivery of information technology services with that of the needs of an enterprise and stresses on benefits to customers.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nITIL best practices&nbsp;is a collection of best practices for information technology service management; it is globally recognized and practiced. A conclusive ITSM audit makes it possible for the executives and management of an organization to determine the actual status of various processes and identify the problem prone areas. In order to function exceptionally, ITSM requires in-house expertise. One good way to make sure of this is to have people within the organization who are ITIL foundation certified or to get them certified from <strong>ITIL Certification Management Board<\/strong> (ICMB).<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAn IT service organization which is managed well delivers outstanding IT services by mitigating the risks, increasing the returns and on the same go hits the targets an organization wants to accomplish. For establishing a reputation in the market, it is very important that an organization concentrates on almost all process areas of IT service management (ITSM) and then invests in the most profitable and best possible ITSM solution.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>A very important factor &ldquo;management of information system&rdquo;<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Information is no doubt one of the essential corporate resources, ensuring better utilization of all other important resources such as machines, materials, methods, money and the most important, the human resource. Executives and administrators have realized that if appropriate information at the right time and at the right place is not on the show other resources might not be fully utilized either. And without any doubts a fully informed manager always finds himself in a better place to take decisions than the ones who are not informed well.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Finally, the question again pops up, why choose ITIL? <\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>ITIL will never mess with your brain by giving you ostentatious procedures and processes, it just teaches you how to identify your goals and accordingly, gives you an insight about how to strategize and then getting our programs into a live environment, be sure of the thing that it will not leave you half way, it shows you the path for continuous improvement also. So ITIL is the best possible path to take for a successful journey in IT.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<hr \/>We provide training programs for <a

It is all about meeting customer needs and improving their experience with a company.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Primarily the purpose of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/it-service-management\/itil-intermediate-sd-training\">IT Service Design <\/a>stage of the lifecycle is the design of a changed or new service and getting it ready for the introduction into the live environment. It is important to cover all areas of concern in the design process that is why a holistic approach to all aspects of design should be adopted. So that while changing or modifying any of the individual elements of design all the other aspects are surely to be considered.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>That is why designing and developing a new application shouldn&#39;t be done in isolation. It is important to estimate the impact on the overall service, the tools and management systems (e.g. Service Catalogue and Service Portfolio), the technology, the Service Management processes, the architectures and all the other necessary measurements and metrics.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>We will start with focusing our attention to a term called Service catalogue which is an important area in Designing<\/strong><\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Catalogue <\/strong>are designed and created to provide in-depth information. It provides the user with vital information regarding quality, utility, co-branding including all other basic details such as warranty, telephone numbers, address, and e-mails for a consumer friendly marketing. This simple technique gives a clear understanding of the product which in turn enhances the sale because consumers don&rsquo;t need to assume anything; everything is clearly documented in the catalogue itself.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong>Service Catalogue Management<\/strong> (SCM) process provides the means of devoting that care and attention in a consistent fashion, ensuring that the organization accrues all of the potential benefits of a service catalogue in the most efficient manner possible.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>Now coming to other important areas in designing such as Availability management and Capacity management<\/strong><\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Availability <\/strong>is a very crucial area regarding the warranty of a service. If a service is not able to deliver the levels of availability required, then the fact is inevitable that business will not experience the value that has been promised. Without the availability factor it is not possible to assess the utility of the service. <strong>Availability management process<\/strong> activity extends across the service lifecycle<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The key purpose of <strong>availability management process<\/strong> is to make sure that the level of availability delivered in all IT services meets the agreed availability needs and\/or service level targets in a cost-effective and timely manner. <strong>Availability management<\/strong> is concerned with meeting both the current and future availability needs of the business.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Capacity Management<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/capacity-management-in-ppo-module-rrt3co17vd306-video\">Capacity management <\/a>ensures that appropriate IT infrastructure is offered on correct time at a suitable price and volume. It is further accountable for the efficient use of IT.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Capacity management<\/strong> stretches across the service lifecycle. The primary success factor in managing capacity is to make sure that it is taken into consideration during the design stage.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Like availability, capacity is also a crucial part regarding the warranty of a service. If a service does not deliver the levels of capacity and performance required, then the business will not experience the value that has been promised. Without capacity and performance the utility of the service cannot be accessed.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>SLM (Service level management) is another important topic which can&rsquo;t be left unturned <\/strong><\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Executing <strong>SLM<\/strong> processes in organizations makes it possible for the IT staff to provide the accurate service levels required for the business. The <strong>SLM<\/strong> processes are not only helpful for business and IT to understand their roles &amp; responsibilities but are also very helpful in improving their business units.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The key purpose of the <strong>SLM<\/strong> process is to make sure the current and planned IT services are delivered to agreed and achievable targets. It also makes sure that the operational services and their performances are evaluated at regular intervals within the organization and the services which are produced will meet the requirements of the customers<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>Last and the most important topic to be discussed is Information Security Management <\/strong><\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/information-security-governance-and-risk-management-rrt3co34vd97-video\"><strong>Information security<\/strong> <\/a>is one of the most important aspects regarding the warranty of a service. If the security of a service&rsquo;s information and information processing cannot be maintained at the levels required by the business, then the business will not experience the value that has been promised. Without information security the utility of the service cannot be accessed.<br \/>\r\n&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<hr \/>We provide training programs for ITIL Intermediate RCV in the following cities:<br \/>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width: 213px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/it-service-management\/itil-intermediate-rcv-training-detroit\/pct2371co22\">DETROIT<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width: 213px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/it-service-management\/itil-intermediate-rcv-training-chicago\/pct2150co22\">CHICAGO<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width: 213px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/it-service-management\/itil-intermediate-rcv-training-seattle\/pct2132co22\">SEATTLE<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t<\/tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width: 213px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/it-service-management\/itil-intermediate-rcv-training-new-york-city\/pct2118co22\">NEW YORK CITY<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width: 213px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/it-service-management\/itil-intermediate-rcv-training-columbus\/pct2481co22\">COLUMBUS<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width: 213px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/it-service-management\/itil-intermediate-rcv-training-bangalore\/pct47co22\">BANGALORE<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t<\/tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width: 213px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/it-service-management\/itil-intermediate-rcv-training-atlanta\/pct2138co22\">ATLANTA<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width: 213px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/it-service-management\/itil-intermediate-rcv-training-baltimore\/pct2121co22\">BALTIMORE<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width: 213px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/it-service-management\/itil-intermediate-rcv-training-hyderabad\/pct46co22\">HYDERABAD<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t<\/tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width: 213px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/it-service-management\/itil-intermediate-rcv-training-tampa\/pct2199co22\">TAMPA<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width: 213px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/it-service-management\/itil-intermediate-rcv-training-philadelphia\/pct2160co22\">PHILADELPHIA<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width: 213px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/it-service-management\/itil-intermediate-rcv-training-delhi\/pct66co22\">DELHI<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t<\/tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width: 213px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/it-service-management\/itil-intermediate-rcv-training-raleigh\/pct2175co22\">RALEIGH<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width: 213px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/it-service-management\/itil-intermediate-rcv-training-san-francisco\/pct2169co22\">SAN FRANCISCO<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width: 213px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/it-service-management\/itil-intermediate-rcv-training-pune\/pct55co22\/\">PUNE<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t<\/tr>\r\n\t<\/tbody>\r\n<\/table>","h1Tag":null,"url":"resources\/it-service-management-articles\/an-overview-of-itil-service-design-rar62","status":"1","image_url":"http:\/\/cfs22.simplicdn.net\/ice9\/free_resources_article_thumb\/freeresources_freeresources_517e6b59bca3d_53d1ef3dd5367.jpg","created_at":"2012-01-15T00:00:00+00:00","updated_at":null,"infographic_url":null,"thumbnail_url":"NULL","shares":0,"likes":0,"comments":0,"engagement_score":0,"segments":[],"skills":[],"tags":[],"id":"56dfb0f1ac530efd098b4592"},{"course_id":[],"type":"article","label_id":"2","vertical":null,"name":"ITIL Service operation and its importance.","display_name":"ITIL Service operation and its importance.","author_name":null,"author_description":null,"author_image":null,"author_linkedin_profile":null,"author_twitter_profile":null,"short_description":null,"article_content":"<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>ITIL Service Operation<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>In ITIL, service operation is the 4<sup>th<\/sup> stage in hierarchy and in this stage all we see is monitoring and action.<\/strong><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe management of the day-to-day operation of services is called <a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/resources\/it-service-management-videos\/organizing-for-service-operation-in-so-module-rrt3co17vd316\" title=\"Service operation\"><strong>Service operation<\/strong><\/a>.

It starts from detecting events, making sense of them and then determining a proper control action. All this is coordinated by the event management process.<br \/>\r\nAn event can be described as any change of state that is important for the management of a <strong>configuration item (CI)<\/strong> or <strong>IT service<\/strong>. Events are mostly recognized through the medium of notifications created by a Configuration item, an IT service or monitoring tool.<br \/>\r\n<strong>Event management<\/strong> acts as a foundation for operational monitoring and control. If the events are<br \/>\r\nefficiently programmed to communicate operational information as well as warnings and exceptions,<br \/>\r\nthey can be used as a basic tool for automating many routine operations management activities.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<strong>Incident management<\/strong><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAccording to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/it-service-management\" title=\"ITIL\"><strong>ITIL<\/strong> <\/a>nomenclature, an &lsquo;<strong>incident<\/strong>&rsquo; is described as an unplanned interruption to an <strong>IT<\/strong> <strong>service<\/strong> or fall in the quality of an <strong>IT service<\/strong>. It can also be a failure of a CI (configuration item) that has not yet made any impact on an IT service.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe<strong> Incident management<\/strong> process is responsible for managing the lifecycle of all incidents. Incidents can be reported from a number of sources such as technical staff or by third-party suppliers and partners.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nMain aim of the <strong>incident management<\/strong> is to restore normal service operation as soon as possible and mitigate the negative impact on business operations, thus making&nbsp; sure that agreed service levels of quality are met.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<strong>Problem management<\/strong><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<strong>Problem management<\/strong> aims to manage the lifecycle of all the problems, starting from identification<br \/>\r\nthen moving towards investigation, documentation and eventually the removal. Problem management<br \/>\r\ntries to mitigate the adverse impact of problems and incidents on the business, which are caused by<br \/>\r\nunderlying errors within the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/resources\/it-service-management-videos\/service-design-rrt3co18vd361\" title=\"IT Infrastructure\"><strong>IT Infrastructure<\/strong><\/a>. Problem management proactively works towards the<br \/>\r\nprevention of recurrence of incidents related to these errors. To achieve all this, <strong>problem management<\/strong><br \/>\r\ngoes to the root cause of incidents. Communicates and documents the known errors and then starts the initiative for actions to improve or rectify the situation.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<strong>Access management<\/strong><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<strong>Access management<\/strong> is a process which is used for granting the access to users to make use of data, IT Services or other Assets. <strong>Access Management<\/strong> works for the protection of Confidentiality, Availability and Integrity of Assets by making sure that only authorized Users can access or modify the Assets. <strong>Access Management<\/strong> is also referred as Identity Management or Rights Management<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<strong>Request fulfillment<\/strong><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe process for managing Service Requests is known as Request Fulfillment Process, which most<br \/>\r\nof the times are small, these are low risk changes which are initially processed via the Service Desk.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nWhat is a Service Request?<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nA Service Request can be described as &quot;a request for a change, most of the times both<br \/>\r\nstraightforward and common, which are to be made to a service.<br \/>\r\n&quot;A request for an additional or new service (i.e. hardware or software) is mostly not taken as an<br \/>\r\nIncident but as a Request for Change (RFC).

This will make trainees understand how strategies can be developed to give the business a stand out advantage in the market. During the Service Strategy phase an organization identifies its market: where they need to target and how to make their presence better in the market than its competitors. The management team of the organization makes its first attempt to understand the costs and risks associated with their <strong>Service portfolio<\/strong>, and use of this information helps a lot in operational decision-making. Having proper strategies in place definitely gives the company a productive and proactive approach to their business operations.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>One important factor of Service strategy is demand management.<\/strong><\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Managing demand for service is very important. Surplus subscription for services can be a sure source of risk. Many examples are out there where supply has been knocked off by demand. If demand is not catered properly it represents a risk for service providers because it represents uncertainty.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Demand management <\/strong>is basically about estimation and forecasting. Demand management helps us in planning which is to be shaped with the business and total cost of ownership needs to be understood completely. For many organizations it is still an upcoming area, the benefits in terms of cost savings to the business and strengthening the ever-important relationship between the business and IT are clear.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>&ldquo;Business Relationship management&rdquo; is another futuristic process.<\/strong><\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Business Relationship Management (BRM) is one of the latest processes in the Service Strategy lifecycle. One of the key purposes of ITIL is to establish a lasting and healthy relationship between the service provider and customer about meeting and understanding the business requirements. Customer satisfaction is the primary concern.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>BRM process overall, gives a good focus and distinction between managing business outcomes and the strategic requirements. Establishing and glorifying the business and strategy continues to be the only or we can say primary direction of the <strong>ITIL framework<\/strong> in which the BRM process gives us a clear way to reach our goals.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>Financial management is a very important aspect of Service Strategy, business always means capital and capital needs management so this is where financial management comes into play<\/strong>.<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>In the strategizing part of ITIL that is the <strong>Service strategy<\/strong>; financial management holds a very important place. Significance of financial management can hardly be overemphasized; it is a very crucial aspect of management.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Financial management is an area wherein the management of finances of a business organization is to achieve different and difficult financial objectives. It is the process through which we put our numbers to work so that our business and money both touch the stone of success. Good financial management always helps the system to know how and why the business is doing great financially.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>The Outcome:<\/strong><\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>To sum up whatever we discussed above, in Service strategy we get our plans ready, how to manage the demand, the Business relations and the very important management of finances all these aspects and much more are planned for action in this stage of ITIL. So without any doubts with the very first stage <strong>&ldquo;Service strategy&rdquo;,<\/strong> ITIL shows us the way to success.<br \/>\r\n&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<hr \/>We provide training programs for ITIL Intermediate SO in the following cities:<br \/>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width: 213px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/it-service-management\/itil-intermediate-so-training-baltimore\/pct2121co26\">BALTIMORE<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width: 213px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/it-service-management\/itil-intermediate-so-training-portland\/pct2268co26\">PORTLAND<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width: 213px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/it-service-management\/itil-intermediate-so-training-mumbai\/pct45co26\">MUMBAI<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t<\/tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width: 213px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/it-service-management\/itil-intermediate-so-training-philadelphia\/pct2160co26\">PHILADELPHIA<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width: 213px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/it-service-management\/itil-intermediate-so-training-manama\/pct3276co26\">MANAMA<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width: 213px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/it-service-management\/itil-intermediate-so-training-pune\/pct55co26\">PUNE<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t<\/tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width: 213px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/it-service-management\/itil-intermediate-so-training-san-francisco\/pct2169co26\">SAN FRANCISCO<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width: 213px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/it-service-management\/itil-intermediate-so-training-dubai\/pct489co26\">DUBAI<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width: 213px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/it-service-management\/itil-intermediate-so-training-delhi\/pct66co26\">DELHI<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t<\/tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width: 213px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/it-service-management\/itil-intermediate-so-training-seattle\/pct2132co26\">SEATTLE<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width: 213px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/it-service-management\/itil-intermediate-so-training-denver\/pct2131co26\">DENVER<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width: 213px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/it-service-management\/itil-intermediate-so-training-bangalore\/pct47co26\">BANGALORE<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t<\/tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width: 213px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/it-service-management\/itil-intermediate-so-training-houston\/pct2140co26\">HOUSTON<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width: 213px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/it-service-management\/itil-intermediate-so-training-hyderabad\/pct46co26\">HYDERABAD<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width: 213px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/it-service-management\/itil-intermediate-so-training-chennai\/pct27co26\">CHENNAI<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t<\/tr>\r\n\t<\/tbody>\r\n<\/table>","h1Tag":null,"url":"resources\/it-service-management-articles\/itil-service-strategy-rar64","status":"1","image_url":"http:\/\/cfs22.simplicdn.net\/ice9\/free_resources_article_thumb\/freeresources_ITIL_Service_Strategy_5195e1e76c8c2.jpg","created_at":"2012-01-29T00:00:00+00:00","updated_at":null,"infographic_url":null,"thumbnail_url":"NULL","shares":0,"likes":0,"comments":0,"engagement_score":0,"segments":[],"skills":[],"tags":[],"id":"56dfb0f1ac530efd098b4594"},{"course_id":["29"],"type":"article","label_id":"2","vertical":"business","name":"ITIL Service Transition \u2013 Processes and Practices Involved","display_name":"ITIL Service Transition \u2013 Processes and Practices Involved","author_name":"Eshna","author_description":"Eshna is a writer at Simplilearn.

The knowledge within the realm of service transition might include:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Identity of stake holders<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Performance expectations and acceptable risk levels<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Timescales and available resources<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The quality and relevance of the knowledge relies on the accessibility, quality and continued relevance of the basic data and information available to the service staff<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The key purpose of knowledge management process is to share ideas, perspectives information and experience; secondly &nbsp;to make sure that these are available in the right place at the right time to enable better and informed decisions; and third to improve efficiency by mitigating the need for rediscovering knowledge.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>Release and deployment management is one more important area in Service transition.<\/strong><\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/release-and-deployment-management-in-rcv-module-rrt3co17vd308-video\" title=\"Release and Deployment Management\">Release and Deployment Management <\/a>is a set of various strategies, key points and techniques including building and testing the Release, planning a Release ,planning the deployment, planning pilots, deploying the Release, testing the deployment, communicating with Change Management and inform the Change Management that Release has been deployed<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The overall process of Release and Deployment is interlinked with, <strong>Service Validation and Testing<\/strong>, <strong>Change Management<\/strong> and <strong>Service Evaluation<\/strong>. The final Release needs a green signal from the Change Advisory Board (CAB) to go into production; this approval approves that during all stages of Release and Deployment product was monitored, so it&#39;s all set for mass production. Release and Deployment Management also makes it sure that customers have the skills and knowledge to use the service to its full potential and that the support staff and operations are well informed about the service levels and the warranties of the product. The <strong>Release and Deployment Management<\/strong> department is also considered as the lifeblood of the Service Transition process.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>Service asset and configuration management (SACM) is a topic which can&rsquo;t be left unexplained. <\/strong><\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The purpose of the SACM process is to make sure that the assets required to deliver services are properly controlled, and make sure that reliable and accurate information about these assets is available wherever and whenever it is required.

Transition is a change and the most important area in Transition is managing the change, the process is called Change Management.<\/strong><\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Change management<\/strong> is a term that very often falls into controversies. Sometimes it&#39;s a victim, if the result is less than targeted: &quot;That initiative failed because we didn&#39;t focus enough on change management. Not to forget at times it helps to gather eyeballs for project activities that might otherwise get overlooked: &quot;Everything was possible because we implemented the new process; let&#39;s not forget about the change management.&quot;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Change management <\/strong>is a process which assures that the changes which are taking place in the organization are monitored throughout the stages so that no scope of error is left unturned.

it also keeps a track of goals which are met and conditions which are not fulfilled.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is always good to create and have a <strong>Service Level Agreement<\/strong> in hand because it does not leave anything to chance or expectations. Main objective of an SLA is that it brings together the parties involved in an agreement; it outlines the details involved regarding work, deadlines and resources.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>SLA<\/strong> traditionally will keep the record of expectations and responsibilities of the two parties involved in writing. So, it becomes very convenient for the party that needs the work done, they will have a clear idea of what they will be receiving. Meanwhile the vendor or party who are there to execute the project provides the customer with actual estimate of the capabilities.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>This method of documenting things clearly gives out what the expectations of services are and what work is to be received. All this is legally bound and is no longer dependent on the individual interpretation. In this manner there is no scope left for the parties to play the blame game. Projects wherein significant amount of money is exchanged, an SLA can be of immense importance as it prevents the misunderstanding and miscommunication.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>A <strong>Service Level Agreement<\/strong> guards the interests of the parties involved in the agreement.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Service level agreement<\/strong> is beneficial in a number of ways. It acts as a tool to create a more empowering business relationship between providers and consumers. Service level agreement serves as a communication builder.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the greatest reasons why we should have a <strong>service level agreement<\/strong> is that it creates a very calming and relaxed environment for both parties. Main reasons of disputes in business mostly arise because of misunderstandings and miscommunications. Sharing understanding and having a clear view on top priorities and necessities of each other&#39;s makes things go smoothly and much easier.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Service Level Management:<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Service Level Management (SLM)<\/strong> is one of the five components in the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/it-service-management\/itil-intermediate-sd-training\"><strong>ITIL<\/strong> Service Delivery <\/a>area. SLM without any doubts is the most important set of processes in the ITIL framework. SLM processes gives out a framework which define services, and the service levels which are required to support the business processes. <strong>Operational Level Agreements (OLAs) <\/strong>and <strong>Service Level Agreements (SLAs) <\/strong>are basically developed to satiate the needs of agreements, and the costs of the developed services.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Implementation of <strong>Service Level Management<\/strong> processes allows the IT staff to identify levels of services to the business more accurately and cost effectively. These processes make sure that IT and businesses both understand their responsibilities and roles, so that they can empower the business units.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Service Level Management<\/strong> activities also include<\/p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Identifying what actually the business requires by working with the business units<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Creating the scope of services such as, service performance, timeliness, and hours of operation and recovery aspects.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Transforming the business requirements into the IT requirements<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Carrying out a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/resources\/it-security-management\/drawing-a-security-plan-for-an-organization\">gap analysis <\/a>i.e. the gap between the business requirements and services

Goldratt in 1997. Followers of this methodology of Project Management claim it to be an alternative to the established standard of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/project-management\">Project Management<\/a> as advocated by PMBOK&reg; and other Standards of Project Management. This article attempts to provide a brief overview of the Principals of Critical Chain Project Management and its applicability to manage Projects across all organizations and verticals.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Critical Chain Method has its roots in another one of Dr. Goldratt&rsquo;s inventions viz. The Theory of Constraints (TOC). This Project Management Method comes into force after the initial Project Schedule is prepared, which includes establishment of the task dependencies. The evolved Critical path is reworked based on the Critical Chain Method. To do so, the methodology suggests and assumes constraints related to each task. A few of them are elaborated as under.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: circle;\">\r\n\t<li>There is a certain amount of uncertainty in each task<\/li>\r\n\t<li>The task Durations are overestimated by the Team Members or Task Owners. This is typically done to add a safety margin to the task so as to be certain of its completion in the decided duration.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>In most cases, the tasks should not take the time estimated, which includes the safety margin, and should be completed earlier.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>If the Safety Margin assumed is not needed, it is actually wasted. If the task completes earlier, it may not necessarily mean that the successor task can start earlier as the resources required for the successor task are not available until their schedule time. Hence the saved time cannot be passed on to finish the Project early. On the other hand, if there are delays over and above the estimated schedules, these delays will most definitely get passed on, and in most of the cases, will exponentially increase the Project Schedule.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<p>With the above assumptions, the Critical Path Methodology of Project Management recommends pooling of the task buffers and adding them at the end of the Critical path<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\" style=\"margin-left: 0.5in;\"><img alt=\"Critical Path Methodology\" height=\"288\" src=\"http:\/\/cfs22.simplicdn.net\/ice9\/general\/ccm_01.jpg\" title=\"Critical Path Methodology\" width=\"613\" \/><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 0.5in;\">The Critical Path Project Management defines&nbsp;three types of Buffers<\/p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Project Buffer -&nbsp; The total pooled buffer shown above (Fig 1.1) is referred to as the Project Buffer.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Feeding Buffer - In a Project Network there are path\/s which feed into the Critical path. The pooled buffer on each such path represents the Feeding Buffer to the Critical Path(Fig1.2) resulting in providing some slack to the critical Path.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Resource Buffer- This is a virtual task inserted just&nbsp;before to critical chain tasks that require critical resources. This acts as a trigger point for the resource indicating when the critical path is about to start.<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\" style=\"margin-left: 0.5in;\"><img alt=\"CCPM Methodology\" height=\"301\" src=\"http:\/\/cfs22.simplicdn.net\/ice9\/general\/ccm_02.jpg\" title=\"CCPM Methodology\" width=\"642\" \/><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the Progress of the Project is reported the Critical Chain is recalculated. In fact, monitoring and controlling of the Project primarily focuses on utilization of the Buffers. Hence the Critical Chain Method, takes in the basic Critical Path based Project Network and Schedule and derives a completely new Schedule.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Critical Path Project Management Methodology proves to be very effective in organizations, which do not have evolved <a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/prince2-structure-rar127-article\">Project Management Practices<\/a>. Also, it is seen that the methodology does not advocate multi-tasking and hence in Projects with complex Schedule Networks, the results of implementing the Critical path Methodology have proven to be deterrent to the overall Project Schedule. In addition, there is no standard method, which has evolved for calculating and optimizing the Project Buffers. The Critical Path Project Management Methodology has had a fair amount of success in manufacturing domains though it has not achieved any noteworthy success in the IT Sector.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Similarly in lines with the principals of Critical Chain Methodology, the Event Chain Methodology of Project Management focuses on determining the uncertain events and the chain Reactions they propagate. It is a method of modelling uncertainties and is based on Monte Carlo Analysis, Bayesian Believe Network and other established simulation methodologies. Events when occurred can cause other events triggering an Even Chain, which will effectively alter the course of the Project. Events and Event Chains are identified and a Quantitative Analysis is performed to determine the extent of the uncertainty and the probable impact of the same on the Project. From this exercise, Critical Event Chains are evolved which have the potential to cause the most impact on the Project. Event Chain diagrams are visual representation of the Event and Event Chains and their impact.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is clear that, neither the Critical Path Project Management Methodology nor the Event Chain Methodology can be considered as alternatives to the standard Methodology for project Management as advocated by PMBOK&reg;. While the Critical Path Project Management Methodology can be at best used as a tool for deriving Project Schedule networks, the Event Chain Methodology for Project Management can be used as a tool for <a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/perform-quantitative-risk-analysis-rrt3co14vd62-video\">Quantitative Risk Analysis<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<hr \/>We provide CAPM classroom training in the following cities:<br \/>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"1\" style=\"width: 150px;\">\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/project-management\/capm-certification-training-pune\/pct55co2\">PUNE<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/project-management\/capm-certification-training-delhi\/pct66co2\">DELHI<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/project-management\/capm-certification-training-edmonton\/pct2507co2\">EDMONTON<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t<\/tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/project-management\/capm-certification-training-bangalore\/pct47co2\">BANGALORE<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/project-management\/capm-certification-training-kolkata\/pct54co2\">KOLKATA<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/project-management\/capm-certification-training-vancouver\/pct2928co2\">VANCOUVER<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t<\/tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/project-management\/capm-certification-training-hyderabad\/pct46co2\">HYDERABAD<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/project-management\/capm-certification-training-ahmedabad\/pct72co2\">AHMEDABAD<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/project-management\/capm-certification-training-victoria\/pct14009co2\">VICTORIA<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t<\/tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/project-management\/capm-certification-training-mumbai\/pct45co2\">MUMBAI<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/project-management\/capm-certification-training-montreal\/pct3150co2\">MONTREAL<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/project-management\/capm-certification-training-reno\/pct2381co2\">RENO<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t<\/tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/project-management\/capm-certification-training-chennai\/pct27co2\">CHENNAI<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/project-management\/capm-certification-training-mississauga\/pct14967co2\">MISSISSAUGA<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/project-management\/capm-certification-training-plano\/pct2265co2\">PLANO<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t<\/tr>\r\n\t<\/tbody>\r\n<\/table>","h1Tag":"What is Critical Chain Project Management?","url":"resources\/project-management-articles\/what-is-critical-chain-project-management-rar68","status":"1","image_url":"http:\/\/cfs22.simplicdn.net\/ice9\/free_resources_article_thumb\/freeresources_517e6daae616c.jpg","created_at":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","updated_at":null,"infographic_url":null,"thumbnail_url":"NULL","shares":0,"likes":0,"comments":0,"engagement_score":0,"segments":[],"skills":[],"tags":[],"id":"56dfb0f1ac530efd098b4598"},{"course_id":["10"],"type":"article","label_id":"1","vertical":"business","name":"PMBOK\u00ae - A Guide to Project Management Body of Knowledge","display_name":"PMBOK\u00ae - A Guide to Project Management Body of Knowledge","author_name":null,"author_description":null,"author_image":null,"author_linkedin_profile":null,"author_twitter_profile":null,"short_description":"The Guide to Project Management Body of Knowledge, generally referred to as PMBOK\u00ae, is the single most authentic resource for learning Project Management.","article_content":"<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>A Guide to Project Management Body of Knowledge <\/strong><\/h2>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>PMBOK &ndash; The Bible for Project Managers<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The Project Management Guide, which is an internationally recognized Standard (IEEE, ANSI), is used as a reference for most of the professional development programs based on Project Management.&nbsp; Various institutes and institutions offer Professional Courses on Project Management.&nbsp; The curriculum designed is largely based on the Guide to Project Management Body of Knowledge i.e, the PMBOK&reg; and other Project Management books and Standards advocated by the Project Management Institute PMI&reg;. The PMI&reg; is the world&rsquo;s largest not-for-profit organization for Project Management. It serves the Project Management community through its various initiatives, where advocating the Best Practices in Project, Program and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/project-portfolio-management-an-overview-rar88-article\">Portfolio Management <\/a>is in the forefront. The PMI&reg; has regularly updated the PMBOK&reg;. The first edition was actually published by the PMI&reg; as a white paper in the year 1983. The Guide to Project Management Body of Knowledge is now in its 5th edition released recently in 2013.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Project Management Guide represents the SUM total of knowledge present within the profession of Project Management. The PMBOK&reg; provides a framework for guidelines, rules and characteristics of Projects across industries. Its standards are widely accepted and when, consistently applied, help you and your organization achieve professional excellence. The knowledge, standards and practices framed within the Project Management Guide, are applicable to <em>most<\/em> of the Projects, <em>most<\/em> of the times in <em>most<\/em> of the industry verticals.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Project Management Guide is all about processes, their interactions, integration and their interface points. The process interactions defined are a variation of the Deming&rsquo;s Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle. The PMBOK&reg; also serves to promote and establish a common vocabulary for the Project Management Profession. The guide suggests tools and techniques for each process as well as provides a basis for defining inputs and outputs for the same. It defines the basic concepts of Project, Project Management, Role of Project Manager in different Organizational Structures, Project Management phases and the Project Life Cycle. &nbsp;The guide provides a comprehensive approach to balance the project constraints, which include, but are not limited to the following:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Scope<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Quality<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Schedule<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Budget<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Resources and<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Risk<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The PMBOK&reg; in its 5<sup>th<\/sup> edition is structured around 5 Process Groups viz. Initiating, Planning, Executing, Monitoring and Controlling and Closing. Furthermore, 10 Knowledge areas are mapped to the 5 Process Group by unique individual Processes. The 10 Knowledge Areas are as under:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/project-integration-management-rrt3co10vd31-video\">Project Integration Management<\/a><\/li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/project-scope-management-importance-rar89-article\">Project Scope Management<\/a><\/li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/project-time-management-rrt3co10vd33-video\">Project Time Management<\/a><\/li>\r\n\t<li>Project Cost Management<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Project Quality Management<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Project Human Resource Management<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Project Communications Management<\/li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/project-risk-management-rrt3co10vd38-video\">Project Risk Management<\/a><\/li>\r\n\t<li>Project Procurement Management<\/li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/project-stakeholder-management-rrt3co10vd40-video\">Project Stakeholder Management<\/a><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The Project Stakeholder Management is an addition in the PMBOK&reg; 5<sup>th<\/sup> edition. In the earlier edition Project Stakeholder Management was part of the Project Communication Management Knowledge Area. The 5<sup>th<\/sup> edition defines 47 processes around the Process Groups and Knowledge Areas, which are 5 more than those in the previous edition.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aside from laying down guidelines and Practices to deliver Projects, the Project Management Guide also provides a pointer to the expected Interpersonal Skills for a Project Manager. According to the PMBOK&reg; the&nbsp;three tenets, Knowledge, Performance and Personal Skills are the&nbsp;three legs of a tri-pod on which successful projects are shaped. The Guide provides an exhaustive list of the required Interpersonal Skills and suggests ways of honing those skills to maximize Team Performance.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Guide to Project Management Body of Knowledge is thus the most comprehensive resource for the budding Project Management Professional.&nbsp; It holds the Final Word on how Projects are managed. That being the case, it does not advocate following the processes as a rigid diktat, but rather suggests adopting the processes with the vigor and fervor as required by the respective Project to be decided by the Project Manager.<br \/>\r\n&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<hr \/>\r\n<p>We provide PMP training program in the following cities:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"1\" style=\"width: 647px; height: 134px;\">\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/project-management\/pmp-certification-training-al-khubar\/pct568co10\">AL KHUBAR<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/project-management\/pmp-certification-training-muscat\/pct3551co10\">MUSCAT<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/project-management\/pmp-certification-training-accra\/pct18507co10\">ACCRA<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t<\/tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/project-management\/pmp-certification-training-pune\/pct55co10\">PUNE<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/project-management\/pmp-certification-training-lagos\/pct18509co10\">LAGOS<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/project-management\/pmp-certification-training-kolkata\/pct54co10\">KOLKATA<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t<\/tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/project-management\/pmp-certification-training-mumbai\/pct45co10\">MUMBAI<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/project-management\/pmp-certification-training-columbia\/pct2147co10\">COLUMBIA<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/project-management\/pmp-certification-training-chennai\/pct27co10\">CHENNAI<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t<\/tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/project-management\/pmp-certification-training-hyderabad\/pct46co10\">HYDERABAD<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/project-management\/pmp-certification-training-riyadh\/pct566co10\">RIYADH<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/project-management\/pmp-certification-training-ahmedabad\/pct72co10\">AHMEDABAD<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t<\/tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/project-management\/pmp-certification-training-delhi\/pct66co10\">DELHI<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/project-management\/pmp-certification-training-corpus-christi\/pct4982co10\">CORPUS CHRISTI<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/project-management\/pmp-certification-training-bangalore\/pct47co10\">BANGALORE<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t<\/tr>\r\n\t<\/tbody>\r\n<\/table>","h1Tag":null,"url":"resources\/project-management-articles\/pmbok-a-guide-to-project-management-body-of-knowledge-rar73","status":"1","image_url":"http:\/\/cfs22.simplicdn.net\/ice9\/free_resources_article_thumb\/freeresources_517e6deaa2852.jpg","created_at":"2012-01-03T00:00:00+00:00","updated_at":null,"infographic_url":null,"thumbnail_url":"NULL","shares":0,"likes":0,"comments":0,"engagement_score":0,"segments":[],"skills":[],"tags":[],"id":"56dfb0f1ac530efd098b4599"},{"course_id":["10"],"type":"article","label_id":"1","vertical":"business","name":"Insights on Change Control Management \u2013 Part 1","display_name":"Insights on Change Control Management \u2013 Part 1","author_name":null,"author_description":null,"author_image":null,"author_linkedin_profile":null,"author_twitter_profile":null,"short_description":null,"article_content":"<h2><strong><u>Facts on Change Control Management <\/u><\/strong><\/h2>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/change-management-in-projects-prince2-methodology-article\" title=\"Change Management\">Change Management<\/a>, often called Change Control, is simply the process of managing most changes that can have positive OR negative effects on any environment- be it a small organization or a large one, be it department like IT, Human Resources, or a group of functions, or simply the internal way of doing things from day to day.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Change control in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/project-management\r\n\" title=\"project management\">project management<\/a> is a systematic approach to managing all changes to a product, process or system.

Yet, almost all seem to agree that the changes have led to increased control over the way game is played.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Very much like the modern business scenarios in which projects are run, soccer is a quick moving, evolving&nbsp;and strategic sport.&nbsp; Whether it&rsquo;s the long term strategic objective (finishing at the top of the league at the end of season), or near term goals (winning one game at a time) or perhaps most immediate goal (making a substitution for an injury or a crucial player who receives a yellow card during the game), a manager has to ensure all his decisions serve the best interests of his team.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong><u>Team composition<\/u><\/strong> &ndash; A project nowadays more often involves multi ethnic, geographically diverse teams, much like a club soccer team where players of different nationalities come together under the fabric of the same club, pursuing the same objective, to ensure their club finishes top of the league at the end of the season. To make matters worse, the manager may not be proficient in the language of choice for the foreign players. Yet, there is no excuse for not managing the team well, much less for the project not achieving its objective.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong><u>Team composition for the game<\/u> &ndash; <\/strong>Of all the available resources, this is one of the most crucial tasks before the start of the game.&nbsp; Whether it&rsquo;s the role or the number of players in each role, like number of strikers &amp; midfielders, whether to have forward midfielders on the wings, 2 strikers upfront, or only 1, or the positioning of a striker as a left winger, all these are crucial decision points. As a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/resources\/project-management-articles\/project-scope-management-and-its-importance-rar89\">project manager<\/a>, it&rsquo;s important to visualize and utilize your players&rsquo; natural abilities and put them in suitable roles. It&rsquo;s tricky and it will take time, but it will make all the difference in the effectiveness of the team<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong><u>Who&rsquo;s playing <\/u><\/strong>&ndash; It&rsquo;s always important to bear in mind that while instructions are vital, the implementation of the game plan is dependent on the people in the middle of the field. The most well thought out plans fail due to lack of implementation. A manager on the sidelines, watches the performance &amp; suggests changes and guides the efforts however he can&rsquo;t step on to the field to play the game. As a project manager, one must remember that the team is made up of professionals and while they need guidance and support, the project manager must not try to step in their shoes or do their jobs for them. Many times, each player \/ team member may just have a style of their own and till the time their demeanor affects team or the outcome negatively, efforts should be made to avoid interference.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong><u>Interruptions &ndash;<\/u><\/strong> The offside rule was introduced in soccer few years back.&nbsp; The rule provides that when a player is behind the last placed defender of the opposite side and the ball, he shall be adjudged to be in a offsite position and hence may not become actively involved in the play.&nbsp; Doing so will lead to a free kick being awarded to the opposite side and in the event of any goal scored, nullification of the goal.&nbsp; In a project there may be interruptions from time to time, for any reason\/s.&nbsp; Whether it&rsquo;s a crucial team member who has to proceed on leaves or a client demanding an extra feature or a previously unknown disruption, things may need to be halted &amp; restarted after adequate measures are taken. As a project manager, regardless of how things are going, its important to regroup, keep the team together and return back to work as soon as possible, readjusting the strategy as and when required.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong><u>Crucial positions <\/u><\/strong>&ndash; Often the measure of determining importance or criticality of a resource is the part he plays in the game. One of the least used, yet one of the most crucial positions is that of a Goalkeeper.&nbsp; One doesn&rsquo;t need to emphasize the importance of this position. In project management, it is important to identify such positions and take steps to fill such positions with the most capable people, while also making sure they understand the dynamics of their role and that they cannot afford to take their eye away from the action even for one moment, for all you know that very moment may define the outcome of the entire endeavor.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong><u>Never get too comfortable<\/u><\/strong> &ndash; Just how many times has one seen a team scoring a goal and then conceding one within next few minutes. To make matters worse, the scenario of &ldquo;what if&rdquo; plays around in the mind and is difficult to be put behind. What happens, when during one stage of the project, the task has been finished ahead of time and under budget, creating buffer for the remaining stages.&nbsp; The team drops its guard and bakes in the glory of its achievement. The next stage then comes in over budget and behind time, thus negating the advantage while creating foul mood, especially if the following stages are crucial than the previous ones. As a project manager one must remember to, not let the guard down or let the success of the moment, cast cloud over efforts made for the next stage.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<hr \/>We provide <a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/agile-and-scrum\/pmi-acp-certification-training\">PMI-ACP training<\/a> program in the following cities:<br \/>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"1\" style=\"width: 377px; height: 174px;\">\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/agile-and-scrum\/pmi-acp-certification-training-colorado-springs\/pct2641co9\">COLORADO SPRINGS<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/agile-and-scrum\/pmi-acp-certification-training-new-york-city\/pct2118co9\">NEW YORK CITY<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/agile-and-scrum\/pmi-acp-certification-training-albuquerque\/pct2288co9\">ALBUQUERQUE<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t<\/tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/agile-and-scrum\/pmi-acp-certification-training-minneapolis\/pct2149co9\">MINNEAPOLIS<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/agile-and-scrum\/pmi-acp-certification-training-los-angeles\/pct2151co9\">LOS ANGELES<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/agile-and-scrum\/pmi-acp-certification-training-salt-lake-city\/pct2696co9\">SALT LAKE CITY<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t<\/tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/agile-and-scrum\/pmi-acp-certification-training-las-vegas\/pct2754co9\">LAS VEGAS<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/agile-and-scrum\/pmi-acp-certification-training-houston\/pct2140co9\">HOUSTON<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/agile-and-scrum\/pmi-acp-certification-training-atlanta\/pct2138co9\">ATLANTA<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t<\/tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/agile-and-scrum\/pmi-acp-certification-training-portland\/pct2268co9\">PORTLAND<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/agile-and-scrum\/pmi-acp-certification-training-denver\/pct2131co9\">DENVER<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/agile-and-scrum\/pmi-acp-certification-training-kansas-city\/pct7099co9\">KANSAS CITY<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t<\/tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/agile-and-scrum\/pmi-acp-certification-training-dallas\/pct2172co9\">DALLAS<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/agile-and-scrum\/pmi-acp-certification-training-phoenix\/pct2193co9\">PHOENIX<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/agile-and-scrum\/pmi-acp-certification-training-irvine\/pct2516co9\">IRVINE<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t<\/tr>\r\n\t<\/tbody>\r\n<\/table>\r\n","h1Tag":null,"url":"resources\/project-management-articles\/efficient-game-strategy-for-project-management-rar78","status":null,"image_url":"http:\/\/cfs22.simplicdn.net\/ice9\/free_resources_article_thumb\/freeresources_517e6ee2169c5.jpg","created_at":"2016-03-09T05:13:21+00:00","updated_at":null,"infographic_url":null,"thumbnail_url":"NULL","shares":0,"likes":0,"comments":0,"engagement_score":0,"segments":[],"skills":[],"tags":[],"id":"56dfb0f1ac530efd098b459e"},{"course_id":["10"],"type":"article","label_id":"1","vertical":"business","name":"Project Management Plans in Project Environment","display_name":"Project Management Plans in Project Environment","author_name":null,"author_description":null,"author_image":null,"author_linkedin_profile":null,"author_twitter_profile":null,"short_description":"Project Management Plan, in PMP Certification, quite simply is the document that lists all of the project requirements, activities, resources, deliverables, acceptance criteria and measure of success.","article_content":"<h2 style=\"text-align: center; margin-left: 0.5in;\"><strong>Project Management Plan<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The Project Management Plan, in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/project-management\/pmp-certification-training\" title=\"PMP Certification\">PMP Certification<\/a>, quite simply is the document that lists all of the project requirements, activities, resources, deliverables, acceptance criteria and measure of success. Through this one document, an effort is made to capture the entire project end-to-end, covering all project phases, from initiation through planning, execution and closure.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nWhen writing a project management plan, the approach depends primarily on the project&#39;s priority, size and context. Project Management plan is perhaps the most important document, with relevance as high as getting the buy in from the sponsor\/stakeholder for the project. Just as the project cannot proceed without stakeholder buy in, without a solid plan proceeding is equally, if not more, disastrous.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe Project Management Plan is a master, and an all-encompassing document. All other plans, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/project-scope-management-importance-rar89-article\" title=\"scope management\">scope management<\/a> plan, cost management plan, schedule management plan, all baselines (performance measurement baseline comprising of cost, schedule and scope baselines), configuration management plan, quality management plan, requirements management plan, communications plan, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/plan-risk-management-rrt3co14vd59-video\" title=\"risk management plan\">risk management plan<\/a> &amp; resource management plan are a part of this master document.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nPlease note: Project planning is iterative. Iterative here means that each phase or part is defined or elaborated more as the work progresses on. That means that the project plan itself will change. It is acceptable till the basic hygiene factors according to the methodology are maintained.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nFor example, in traditional project management, the plan provides an outline of the anticipated project constraints (schedules, budgets etc) through all five stages: initiation, planning, execution, monitoring, and completion. &nbsp;In contrast, agile projects cannot be planned end to end due to the on-demand nature of work. Instead, the plans are created and adjusted throughout the project life-cycle as needed.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe iterative nature however is not an excuse for poor or incomplete planning. Each planning process may use the results of previous process and each process may cause changes to the previous processes. The idea is to complete each planning process as fully as possible. The <a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/role-of-planning-in-project-management-framework-rar226-article\" title=\"Project Management Plan\">project management plan<\/a> is not finalized till the time all risk management processes are completed. After completing all risk management processes, i.e. risk identification, qualitative &amp; quantitative risk analysis, risk response planning etc., project manager goes back to planning document to finalize the project plan.<br \/>\r\n&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Project lifecycle in a multi stage project (Rolling Wave Planning)<\/h2>\r\nFor Projects involving multiple stages (testing, install, roll out etc) iterative project planning is needed. This is due to the underlying condition that the entire project cannot be fully planned to a detailed degree before beginning the work. In such cases, only the first stage or phase of the project (for example Design stage) is fully planned, while other stages are planned only at a higher level with detailed planning for each stage or phase happening as the previous stage nears completion.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nIn a multi-stage project, each stage has the same 5 parts of project management, Initiation, Planning, Execution, Monitoring and Control and Closing.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nFrom PMBOK&reg; guide knowledge areas&rsquo; perspective, Planning is the only process group that involves processes from all the 9 knowledge areas, i.e. Scope, Time, Cost, Quality, Human Resources, Communications, Risk &amp; Procurement<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nWhether the planning is required for a phase or the entire project, the following are listed:\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Overview: Why the project is being conducted and its primary objectives<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Scope: Business needs, requirements, deliverables, constraints and work breakdown structure<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Schedule: Activities schedule and project milestones<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Costs: Project budget and its funding approach<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Quality: Quality measurement and control approach<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Project team: The people working on the project, their roles and responsibilities<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Communication: Communication type, channels and the reporting approach<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Risks: Risk index, methods to identify and evaluate risks, risk mitigation &amp; contingency planning<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Procurements: Required procurements and purchase processes<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Closure: Closure approach, including the deliverables hand-off protocol<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Changes: Procedures used to track changes in the project<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Baselines: Scope, schedule and budget baselines<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Once the plan is complete, the project manager uses the project management plan as a tool to help manage the project on a daily basis. Though it may evolve and change over the lifecycle of a project, the project management plan is designed to be as complete as possible before the execution begins.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<hr \/>We provide PMI-ACP training program in the following cities:<br \/>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"1\" style=\"width: 470px; height: 195px;\">\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/agile-and-scrum\/pmi-acp-certification-training-san-diego\/pct2122co9\">SAN DIEGO<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/agile-and-scrum\/pmi-acp-certification-training-washington\/pct2141co9\">WASHINGTON<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/agile-and-scrum\/pmi-acp-certification-training-anchorage\/pct6186co9\">ANCHORAGE<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t<\/tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/agile-and-scrum\/pmi-acp-certification-training-san-francisco\/pct2169co9\">SAN FRANCISCO<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/agile-and-scrum\/pmi-acp-certification-training-toronto\/pct2848co9\">TORONTO<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/agile-and-scrum\/pmi-acp-certification-training-philadelphia\/pct2160co9\">PHILADELPHIA<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t<\/tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/agile-and-scrum\/pmi-acp-certification-training-chicago\/pct2150co9\">CHICAGO<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/agile-and-scrum\/pmi-acp-certification-training-boise\/pct2886co9\">BOISE<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/agile-and-scrum\/pmi-acp-certification-training-sacramento\/pct2167co9\">SACRAMENTO<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t<\/tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/agile-and-scrum\/pmi-acp-certification-training-san-jose\/pct2157co9\">SAN JOSE<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/agile-and-scrum\/pmi-acp-certification-training-tampa\/pct2199co9\">TAMPA<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/agile-and-scrum\/pmi-acp-certification-training-orange-county\/pct2504co9\">ORANGE COUNTY<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t<\/tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/agile-and-scrum\/pmi-acp-certification-training-seattle\/pct2132co9\">SEATTLE<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/agile-and-scrum\/pmi-acp-certification-training-santa-barbara\/pct2197co9\">SANTA BARBARA<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/agile-and-scrum\/pmi-acp-certification-training-boston\/pct2154co9\">BOSTON<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t<\/tr>\r\n\t<\/tbody>\r\n<\/table>","h1Tag":null,"url":"resources\/project-management-articles\/project-management-plans-in-project-environment-rar79","status":"1","image_url":"http:\/\/cfs22.simplicdn.net\/ice9\/free_resources_article_thumb\/freeresources_517e6f2b4c09f.jpg","created_at":"2012-01-09T00:00:00+00:00","updated_at":null,"infographic_url":null,"thumbnail_url":"NULL","shares":0,"likes":0,"comments":0,"engagement_score":0,"segments":[],"skills":[],"tags":[],"id":"56dfb0f1ac530efd098b459f"},{"course_id":["117"],"type":"article","label_id":"1","vertical":"business","name":"Agile Project Management and Its Impact","display_name":"Agile Project Management and Its Impact","author_name":"Chandana","author_description":"Chandana is working as a Senior Content Writer in Simplilearn.com and handles variety of creative writing jobs.

The Agile project management is highly flexible and interactive model where the requirements and resultant plan to meet those requirements keeps changing with inputs from stakeholders, suppliers and customers.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The traditional practice of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/project-management\">project management<\/a>, often referred to as &ldquo;waterfall&rdquo; project management suffers from various drawbacks, especially when it came to meeting the needs of complex projects where the requirements cannot be stated fully till the time a prototype is developed or on wider projects where there are multiple facets of the product being produced. In addition, when planning happens much in advance, there are chances that requirements may change by the time project comes to closing phase rendering the product ineffective or partially effective. Compare this to a project where one module is developed in short period of time (may be 2&ndash;3 weeks), is implemented, feedback taken from users, any shortcomings identified, and feedback&nbsp;and identified shortcomings built in as requirements in to the next short phase of development. The benefits of Agile Project Management thus become apparent.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another key differentiator between Agile and traditional project management is the focus on people, relationships and working software at the end vs. focus on processes and tools, documentation&nbsp;and following project plan.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Agile Project Management is the result of collaboration between APMG-International and The DSDM Consortium. DSDM (Dynamic Systems Development Method) is the longest-established Agile method, launched in 1995, and is the only Agile method to focus on the management of Agile projects.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong><u>Approaches to Agile<\/u><\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In the Agile world, there are a number of approaches available; the most common of these are DSDM Atern, eXtreme Programming (XP), <a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/agile-and-scrum\">SCRUM <\/a>and Lean. To put these Agile approaches into context:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>XP <\/strong>&ndash; focusing on I.T. development, XP provides developer techniques and practices such as Pair Programming, Continuous Integration etc. There is no concept of a Project in XP, and with the exception of planning, little guidance around management, since the primary purpose of XP is to provide Agile delivery techniques.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Typically where XP is to be used to deliver Agile Projects, it is often combined with other Agile approaches which add-on the Project and Management elements. Examples of this would be XP with DSDM Atern, XP with Scrum.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Scrum<\/strong> provides an excellent team based approach to allow work to be prioritized and delivered, using the concept of a constantly evolving &ldquo;backlog&rdquo; to provide the team&rsquo;s workload. The strength of Scrum is its simplicity, and since it is so easy to describe and to start to use, this has driven its popularity to date.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>However in Scrum, there is no concept of a project, simply a Product Backlog of work to be done. For those wishing to scale Scrum to work as a corporate-wide Agile approach, or to use it for management of projects and releases, there is usually significant extra work needed to overlay the project\/release concept onto the basic Scrum process. Scrum does offer a very simple version of corporate-wide Scrum (referred to as &ldquo;Scrum of Scrums&rdquo;), but in the complex corporate world, there is little confidence in the successful practical application of this.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Scrum is also often combined with DSDM Atern, where Scrum is used at the development team level, and DSDM Atern sits above the team to position the work within a project and to provide the project management elements.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Lean<\/strong> &ndash; an approach which originated in the Toyota manufacturing environment in the 1940s. Lean drives work to be done in an efficient way through its main principle of &ldquo;Eliminate Waste&rdquo;. In practice, this means avoiding anything that does not produce value for the customer. Examples of Lean thinking are &ldquo;don&rsquo;t do all detailed analysis up front, because it will change\/some will not progress to delivery&rdquo; and &ldquo;test throughout, then you don&rsquo;t waste time working on things that do not fit the business&rdquo;. A lean approach can be applied at development level, but it is also often used at the organizational level. Lean is often used in conjunction with other Agile approaches, since it is complementary to most of them, e.g. Lean and DSDM Atern, Lean and Scrum, Lean and XP.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>For more than a decade, agile project management has been used and it wonderfully continues to grow in popularity. It is one effective methodology.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Agility is the ability to both create and respond to change in order to profit in a turbulent business environment - <em>Jim Highsmith, Agile Project Management<\/em><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The difference between Agile &amp; traditional project management can also be elaborated by imagining a relay race where each member passes on the baton to, for the next part, and a football team where the entire team assumes responsibility and tries to go the distance as a unit, passing the ball back &amp; forth.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Agile Project Management enables organizations to gain the benefits of an agile approach without introducing unnecessary risks. This ensures &lsquo;going agile&rsquo; becomes a measured and balanced change, keeping what is good in the current organization and retaining existing good practices around project management and delivery.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong><u>Agile Iterative Development Overview<\/u><\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>With agile project management, the traditional project phases are maintained but during each phase (see below), the amount of work done in each activity rises or falls.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong><u>Agile Scrum Overview<\/u><\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Defines <a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/agile-project-management-and-its-impact-rar80-article\">Project Management Framework<\/a><\/li>\r\n\t<li>Encourages High User\/Customer Involvement<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Promotes Continuous Improvement<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Delivers Iteratively &amp; Incrementally via Sprints<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Ideally Suited for Projects with High Uncertainty<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong><u>Benefits of Agile Project Management<\/u><\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Organizations seeking to adopt an Agile approach are sometimes concerned of some myths surrounding the Agile Project Management framework, like Project Management is irrelevant or unnecessary. This has led some to an incorrect perception that Agile is only applicable for small, simple pieces of work, and that organizations would need to choose either Agile or formal project management and corporate processes. However this perception is incorrect.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>Adoption<\/strong>: An organization can adopt an Agile approach that has a track record of successful management and delivery, and that can complement and work with existing corporate processes, such as PRINCE2, quality and audit processes.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>Certification<\/strong>: Agile Project Management, and its parent process DSDM Atern, have a formal recognized certification process.

exam. This topic is also generally considered to be one of the tougher topics, partly as it involves number crunching and partly as it deals with 3 most important concepts of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/project-management\">Project Management<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>EVM as it is popularly known, is primarily used for measuring project performance and to forecast project performance at the end of the project. When applied properly&nbsp;and consistently, it takes the guess work out of estimating project progress&nbsp;and performance. The &ldquo;project performance&rdquo; is measured on scope, time &amp; cost.&nbsp; Essentially, EVM is a management methodology for integrating scope, schedule, and cost and for measuring project performance and progress.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Very simply put, EVM measures progress of an activity, deliverable and\/or project by comparing the actual value to planned value, thereby indicating the probability of meeting the scope, time &amp; cost budget of the activity, deliverable and\/or project, and need for any corrective action\/s.<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s consider an example. Consider a project that has been well planned, including estimates for each activity in time phased&nbsp;and resource based manner, and all other aspects have been planned. 5 weeks in to the 20th week &amp; USD 75,000 project, PM finds that $ 20,000 has been spent and work on 5 out of 25 activities is nearing completion, with another 2 activities completed. Now the management wants to determine the actual project performance &amp; estimate date of completion basis the actual performance to date. Without an objective method of measuring performance, there is no way for Project Manager to come up with that kind of information. A method is needed to measure technical performance objectively and quantitatively, and that is what EVM does.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Important tip for exam seekers<\/strong>: Scope, Schedule or time &amp; cost each have their own baseline for the project. These 3 baselines are collectively known as &ldquo;performance baseline&rdquo;.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong><u>History of Earned Value Management<\/u><\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>EVM emerged as a financial analysis specialty in United States Government programs in the 1960s, but it has since then become a significant branch of project management and cost engineering. Early EVM research showed that the areas of planning (remember: planning is iterative!) &amp; control is significantly impacted by the use of objective technique such as EVM. The use of EVM also provides useful analysis of overall project performance. The use and popularity of EVM has grown significantly prompting many to rely on it extensively over the years and in multi-faceted projects.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The importance of EVM can be exemplified by the fact that in 1991, Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney canceled the Navy A-12 Avenger II Program due to performance issues detected by EVM.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>An overview of EVM was included in first <a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/pmbok-a-guide-to-project-management-body-of-knowledge-rar73-article\">PMBOK <\/a>Guide in 1987 and expanded in subsequent editions. The construction industry was an early commercial adopter of EVM. Closer integration of EVM with the practice of project management accelerated in the 1990s<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong><u>Understanding EVM <\/u><\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The foundation principle of EVM does not depend on the size or complexity of the project. However, the implementations of EVM can vary significantly depending on the circumstances.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>The first step is to define the work. This is typically done through WBS, or work breakdown structure which is a hierarchical arrangement of activities. A WBS is a top down approach, breaking down project deliverables in to activities which can be controlled &amp; measured.&nbsp; (PMBOK&reg; chapter 3 &amp; PMP&reg; Exam Prep 7<sup>th<\/sup> Edition by Rita Mulcahy Chapter 5)<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li value=\"2\">The second step is to assign a value, called planned value (PV), to each activity. This value can be in units of currency or labor hours, and is a part of the total budget allocation of the project for that particular deliverable. (PMBOK&reg; guide &amp; PMP&reg; Exam Prep 7<sup>th<\/sup> Edition by Rita Mulcahy chapters on Time &amp; Cost Management)<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li value=\"3\">The third step is to define &ldquo;earning rules&rdquo; for each activity. This simply means how the progress of each activity is measured. Some popular rules are 0\/100, which means that no credit is available for starting the activity &amp; 100% credit is applied when the activity is finished. 50\/50, 25\/75 &amp; 20\/80 are some other rules which are applied basis the activity complexity &amp; significance. (See PMP&reg; Exam Prep 7<sup>th<\/sup> Edition by Rita Mulcahy, &nbsp;Chapter 7)<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li value=\"4\">The final step is to execute the project according to the plan and measure progress. When activities are started or finished, EV is accumulated according to the earning rule.<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Henceforth, Earned value is used to analyze the project performance, calculate the variance for schedule and cost and indicates where the project stands in comparison to the estimates calculated earlier for this point in time.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The measurements resulting from Earned Value analysis of the project indicate if there are any potential deviations from the scope, schedule &amp; cost baselines. Many a times one could easily be on time, however may overspend, or may be on time &amp; within budget however scope may be incomplete. In simple terms, EV analysis is better than comparing actual to planned results or by simply guessing the project status.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><u>Also Read: <\/u><\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Earned Value Management &ndash; Part 2<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Earned Value Management &ndash; Part 3<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Earned Value Management &ndash; Part 4<\/strong><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<hr \/>\r\n<p>We provide <a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/project-management\/pmp-certification-training\">PMP training<\/a> program in the following cities:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"1\" style=\"width: 300px;\">\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/project-management\/pmp-certification-training-albany\/pct2805co10\">ALBANY<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/project-management\/pmp-certification-training-mississauga\/pct14967co10\">MISSISSAUGA<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/project-management\/pmp-certification-training-hong-kong\/pct84co10\">HONG KONG<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t<\/tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/project-management\/pmp-certification-training-manila\/pct15766co10\">MANILA<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/project-management\/pmp-certification-training-shanghai\/pct13732co10\">SHANGHAI<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/project-management\/pmp-certification-training-kuwait\/pct17243co10\">KUWAIT<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t<\/tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/project-management\/pmp-certification-training-hong-kong\/pct84co10\">HOUSTON<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/project-management\/pmp-certification-training-victoria\/pct14009co10\">VICTORIA<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/project-management\/pmp-certification-training-doha\/pct3279co10\">DOHA<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t<\/tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/project-management\/pmp-certification-training-jakarta\/pct15722co10\">JAKARTA<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/project-management\/pmp-certification-training-montreal\/pct3150co10\">MONTREAL<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/project-management\/pmp-certification-training-dubai\/pct489co10\">DUBAI<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t<\/tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/project-management\/pmp-certification-training-lagos\/pct18509co10\">LAGOS<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/project-management\/pmp-certification-training-zurich\/pct3185co10\">SWITZERLAND<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/project-management\/pmp-certification-training-edmonton\/pct2507co10\">EDMONTON<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t<\/tr>\r\n\t<\/tbody>\r\n<\/table>\r\n","h1Tag":null,"url":"resources\/project-management-articles\/earned-value-management-and-its-significance-rar81","status":"1","image_url":"http:\/\/cfs22.simplicdn.net\/ice9\/free_resources_article_thumb\/freeresources_517e6f8e1a2d8.jpg","created_at":"2012-01-13T00:00:00+00:00","updated_at":null,"infographic_url":null,"thumbnail_url":"NULL","shares":0,"likes":0,"comments":0,"engagement_score":0,"segments":[],"skills":[],"tags":[],"id":"56dfb0f1ac530efd098b45a1"},{"course_id":[],"type":"article","label_id":"1","vertical":null,"name":"Earned Value Management Explained ","display_name":"Earned Value Management Explained ","author_name":null,"author_description":null,"author_image":null,"author_linkedin_profile":null,"author_twitter_profile":null,"short_description":null,"article_content":"<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><u><strong>Earned Value Management Part-II<\/strong><\/u><\/h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The topic of Earned Value Management is an important one for the PMP&reg; exam.

In other words, EVM is only one tool in the project manager&#39;s toolbox.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Agile projects<\/strong> - Because EVM requires quantification of a project plan, it is often perceived to be inapplicable to discovery-driven or Agile software development projects. For example, it may be impossible to plan certain research projects far in advance, because research itself uncovers some opportunities (research paths) and actively eliminates others. Thus, the challenge is to create agile or discovery-driven implementations of the EVM principle, and not simply to reject the notion of measuring technical performance objectively.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><u>Also Read: <\/u><\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Earned Value Management &ndash;

The PCM Guidelines are targeted at EC Project Managers, their official partners in third countries, and other stakeholders such as non-state bodies and consultants who are engaged in the design and delivery of EC supported projects and programs.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>By Definition, Project Cycle Management is a term used to describe the management activities and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/resources\/project-management\/decision-making-models\">decision making procedures<\/a> used during the lifecycle of the Project. The activities and decision making procedures mentioned pertain to all activities and tasks of the Project as well as key definitions of Roles and Responsibilities, Project Documents and various decision options.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Project Cycle Management is represented as a cyclic process analogous to the Deming&rsquo;s Cycle. The process is continuous and each stage of the PCM provides a foundation for the next stage.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\"><strong>FIGURE 1.1<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The above figure shows a generic Project Cycle Management Framework. In practice, the time and rigor applied to each phase may differ depending on the Project Complexity and Project Manager&rsquo;s discretion. In the Project Cycle Management approach, the Project Life Cycle is an integrated set of Project phases which are cyclic in nature. The phases are progressive and provide for a strong feedback during each phase. All required decision making criteria for the activities for the phase are defined clearly.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Project Life Cycle phases in the Project Cycle Management process are enumerated as under. Each Project Life Cycle phase in the Project Cycle management approach has a clearly defined purpose, the set of Inputs required for the phase, the Activities required to be performed and the Outcomes to be derived from the Phase.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Programming:<\/em><\/strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Purpose- Assessment of the main objectives and priorities of the organization is undertaken in this phase.

As a project manager you are working in your project by integrating, articulating, unifying the entire sub-processes into a cohesive whole and that&rsquo;s all about the project handling. As a project manager you need to be a good integrator to run the project successfully. If you are a PMP certified project manager or you have appeared in a project management training workshop; you must be aware of the terminologies being used in modern day project management. One of the important terms used in modern day project management is DFD (Data Flow Diagram). It is nothing but creating a sequential relationship among the process groups and the concerned sub processes involved in the project management.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>As you know, as a project manager you have to follow the activities involved in the process groups (i.e., Initiation, Planning, Executing, Monitoring and Controlling, and Closing). Now you need to know that, as Integration is the one of the knowledge area, what work you need to do in every process groups, starting from Initiation to closing pertaining to integration management. As per <a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/rita-mulcahys-pmp-prep-and-pmbok-guide-article\" title=\"PMBOK\">PMBOK <\/a>4<sup>th<\/sup> edition, the activities involved in the integration knowledge area are as follows:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><u>Initiation Process Group: <\/u><\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Integration knowledge area, in initiation stage, you develop project charter. A project charter is nothing but an important paper\/document\/authorization letter to start the project, to plan the project. Let me explain you what could be the content of the project charter:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><em>Business need of the project &ndash; How organization will be benefited through this project?<\/em><\/li>\r\n\t<li><em>Objectives of the project &ndash; What would be ultimate goal from this project?<\/em><\/li>\r\n\t<li><em>High level product scope and project scope &ndash; what work you need to perform to get the target set by the customer?<\/em><\/li>\r\n\t<li><em>High level budget information &ndash; what would be the high level cost for the project?<\/em><\/li>\r\n\t<li><em>High level schedule information &ndash; High level information on the completion of the project<\/em><\/li>\r\n\t<li><em>High level associated risk information &ndash; Opportunities and threats associated with the project<\/em><\/li>\r\n\t<li><em>Project acceptance criteria &ndash; Parameters on which project will be treated as a successful project<\/em><\/li>\r\n\t<li><em>Name of the Signatory authority &ndash; Name and signature of the funding authority (May be customer itself or Project Sponsor)<\/em><\/li>\r\n\t<li><em>Name of the project manager &ndash; Authorized project manager&rsquo;s name (if decided earlier)<\/em><\/li>\r\n\t<li><em>Authoritative power of the project manager &ndash; How and at what extent project manager will be involved in the project activities?<\/em><\/li>\r\n\t<li><em>Pre-assigned team members &ndash; Subject Matter Experts name, if decided earlier<\/em><\/li>\r\n\t<li><em>Name of the key stakeholders, like funding authority name, customer etc.<\/em><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<p>And many more activities.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Taking in front all the above mentioned information; you develop the project charter. Based on the information available in the project charter, you plan for your project. Information available in the project charter is the root information for planning the project.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><u>Planning Process Group: <\/u><\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Based on the information available in the project charter; you do planning for your project. Planning process group is nothing but an integration of the all the sub-planning like scope management planning, cost management planning, schedule management planning, quality management planning, human resource planning, communication planning, risk planning, procurement planning, requirement management planning, stakeholder management planning etc. As a project manager you need to trigger all the sub-processes into a cohesive whole to prepare a final project management planning. It is the largest process group as all the knowledge areas got impacted in this process group. As a project manager you need to be more focused while working on the planning process group.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><u>Execution Process Group: <\/u><\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your planning for the project is finished and your team will work on the project as your planning is approved and you have received the work authorization letter to execute the project. Your team will start working on the project as you have planned for. You will create the deliverables and if some change will be noticed you can implement those aligning the baselines (scope baselines, cost performance baselines and schedule baselines) after taking an approval of the change control board or configuration management.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><u>Monitoring &amp; Controlling Process Group:<\/u><\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this process group, you monitor your work performance to check the deviations from the actual planning. Based on the work performance report you can differentiate them with the actual baselines as decided in the planning. You may notice some deviations\/differences and think that you need to revisit some processes, and finally for those revisit you seek project change. If the approved changes are implemented in the project to correct the deviations; your project management planning and pertaining documents could be changed and updated accordingly.

Time is the most treasured resource in a project. Without proper time management, the future of a project can dive into darkness.","article_content":"<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><u>Project Time Management<\/u><\/strong><\/h2>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong><u>Processes Involved in Project Time Knowledge Area<\/u><\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>If you ask me what is the project manager&rsquo;s main role &ndash; I would say to keep schedule within the baselines. You know, a project manager is hired mainly to maintain the delivery schedule. Hence, a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/project-management\/\">project manager training<\/a> chiefly focuses on program management. Software and machinery can ease the work but you really can&rsquo;t monitor and control anything through software and machineries. For doing this you need an individual who can take a decision based on the situation in front. And the project manager does exactly the same. That&rsquo;s why as a project manager you are getting higher salary, just to maintain the schedule and cost performance for your project; mainly the schedule. Remember, if you are running a project successfully, credit will go to entire organization; instead if project fails, blame goes to project manager only. A weak project management policy is solely responsible for project failure and the responsibility and accountability for making it a success goes to the project manager alone.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/agile-and-scrum\/pmi-acp-certification-training\">Project Management Institute (PMI)<\/a> also recommends that a project manager must keep a hawk eye over activities involved in time management. As per <a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/resources\/project-management-articles\/pmbok-a-guide-to-project-management-body-of-knowledge-rar73\">PMBOK <\/a>(Project Management Body of Knowledge), time management knowledge area has been divided into below mentioned activities:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><u>Define Activities:<\/u><\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is an important task performed by a project manager. What you did in the scope management; as you know you have developed WBS up to a work package level through decomposition. Now you need to break up this work package level up to the activity level so that you can work on the work package and deliver the output required for that work package level. You need to define the actual work need, to perform on those activities (activity attributes).<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><u>Sequencing&nbsp; Activities:<\/u><\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the previous process; you have divided the work package into activities and now you need to create a logical and meaningful relationship among those activities. Then only you can perform on the project. You need to decide the occurrence of the activities in your project; which activity will be performed first, which will be second and most importantly what would be the predecessor and successor of these activities. This process is very important as you can allocate your resources smartly on your project based on the predecessor and successor activity. You can allocate resources keeping in mind the activities occurrence in your project.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><u>Estimating Activity Resources:<\/u><\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Previously, you have created a relationship among the activities; now you need to decide the resources like human, materials and machinery and equipment&rsquo;s required for performing those activities. It is very interesting in such a way that you decide your resources based on their timing of occurrence and in that way you can smartly manage your resources. You need to decide the resources before estimating the durations so that you can take your resource&rsquo;s input based on their efficiencies.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><u>Estimating Activity Durations:<\/u><\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now you need to fix a particular time of completion for the activities after estimating the resource requirement per activity. And this timing will be basis for deciding the overall milestone for your project. You need to discuss with your decided resources for the approximate time of completion for their assigned activities. Based on the information received from the resources; you decide the actual timeline for the completion of the activities.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><u>Develop Schedule:<\/u><\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now you need to sum up the activity durations and develop a schedule for your project. The schedule can be for each activity separately and further it could be sum up to create a complete milestone for your project. You need to discuss with different SMEs along with the assigned resources before finalizing the milestone dates for your project. The milestone dates should be realistic and achievable in nature and everyone should feel that it is highly possible to make it happen.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><u>Control Schedule:<\/u><\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s a big task for a project manager to control the schedule every time. It is not one time work for a project manager; it is an all-time task for a project manager. Keep your eye open while controlling the schedule. It is your real examination; as your skill will be checked this time; how you are maintaining the schedule. Utilize your interpersonal skills! Whenever, if there is a change request, as a project manager, you need to analyze the impacts on the schedule for the activities. It should not be impacted, and in any case if it is going to be impacted you need to update the schedule plan accordingly.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<hr \/>We provide <a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/project-management\/prince2-foundation-and-practitioner-certification-training\">PRINCE2 Foundation and Practitioner training<\/a> in the following cities:<br \/>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"1\" style=\"width: 500px;\">\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/project-management\/prince2-foundation-and-practitioner-certification-training-hyderabad\/pct46co335\">HYDERABAD<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/project-management\/prince2-foundation-and-practitioner-certification-training-melbourne\/pct4co335\">MELBOURNE<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/project-management\/prince2-foundation-and-practitioner-certification-training-amsterdam\/pct3173co335\">AMSTERDAM<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t<\/tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/project-management\/prince2-foundation-and-practitioner-certification-training-kolkata\/pct54co335\">KOLKATA<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/project-management\/prince2-foundation-and-practitioner-certification-training-prague\/pct3174co335\">PRAGUE<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/project-management\/prince2-foundation-and-practitioner-certification-training-copenhagen\/pct700co335\">COPENHAGEN<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t<\/tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/project-management\/prince2-foundation-and-practitioner-certification-training-reading\/pct1976co335\">READING<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/project-management\/prince2-foundation-and-practitioner-certification-training-london\/pct333co335\">LONDON<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/project-management\/prince2-foundation-and-practitioner-certification-training-helsinki\/pct3191co335\">HELSINKI<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t<\/tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/project-management\/prince2-foundation-and-practitioner-certification-training-zurich\/pct3185co335\">ZURICH<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/project-management\/prince2-foundation-and-practitioner-certification-training-sydney\/pct5co335\">SYDNEY<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/project-management\/prince2-foundation-and-practitioner-certification-training-mumbai\/pct45co335\">MUMBAI<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t<\/tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/project-management\/prince2-foundation-and-practitioner-certification-training-paris\/pct341co335\">PARIS<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/project-management\/prince2-foundation-and-practitioner-certification-training-pune\/pct55co335\">PUNE<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/project-management\/prince2-foundation-and-practitioner-certification-training-johannesburg\/pct18321co335\">JOHANNESBURG<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t<\/tr>\r\n\t<\/tbody>\r\n<\/table>","h1Tag":null,"url":"resources\/project-management-articles\/project-time-management-and-its-role-in-an-organization-rar87","status":null,"image_url":"http:\/\/cfs22.simplicdn.net\/ice9\/free_resources_article_thumb\/freeresources_517fa1adc109b.jpg","created_at":"2016-03-09T05:13:21+00:00","updated_at":null,"infographic_url":null,"thumbnail_url":"NULL","shares":0,"likes":0,"comments":0,"engagement_score":0,"segments":[],"skills":[],"tags":[],"id":"56dfb0f1ac530efd098b45a7"},{"course_id":["10"],"type":"article","label_id":"1","vertical":"business","name":"Project Portfolio Management \u2013 An Overview","display_name":"Project Portfolio Management \u2013 An Overview","author_name":"Eshna","author_description":"Eshna is a writer at Simplilearn.

These organizations lack a framework to prioritize IT investments resulting in diminished confidence in the eyes of senior executives including Chief Executive Officer or the Chief Financial Officer. However, by managing IT investments as a portfolio of financial investments, risk and returns could be optimized, and assets could be allocated.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nIT Portfolio management is more applicable to larger IT organizations since in smaller organizations, its concerns might be generalized into IT planning and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/it-governance-and-its-significance-rar39-article\">IT governance <\/a>as a whole.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nIn this article we will take a close look at IT Portfolio Management. But before we delve deep into IT portfolio management, we will also have a quick look at the basics of project, program and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/resources\/finance-management-articles\">portfolio management <\/a>and how they are all related to each other.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Project &amp; Project Management<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>A project is a temporary endeavor to create a unique product, service or result.<\/em><\/strong><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nA Project can involve a single person, a single organizational unit or multiple organizational units. It has a definite beginning and end but its benefits may continue to provide an ongoing service.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The development and implementation of web based purchase management software could be considered as a project. The project may involve a team of developers and a project manager, and will have a definite beginning and end. The project will end with the implementation of the software and the benefits of using the purchase management software may also continue to provide an ongoing service to the purchase departments of an organization where the software is implemented.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/project-management\/\"><strong>Project management<\/strong> <\/a>involves the development and implementation of plans to achieve a specific scope that is driven by the objectives of the program or portfolio that projects are subjected to, and ultimately to organizational strategies.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Program &amp; Program Management<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>a program is a group of related projects managed in a coordinated way to obtain benefits and control not available from managing the projects individually.<\/em><\/strong><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nPrograms are composed of various components, a majority of which are the individual projects within the program. Programs may include work related to the component projects such as training and maintenance activities. They also include work not related to a specific project alone, but regarding the entire program such as program governance and stakeholder management.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The implementation of the Enterprise Resource Planning system in an organization could be considered as a Program. The ERP system may include several specific individual projects<br \/>\r\n(Finance, Stores, Purchase, Marketing etc) Each of these specific projects could be run by a project manager using a formal project management approach. The overall grouping of these related projects are run by a program manager.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Program management<\/strong> involves the harmonization of the projects and program components and control interdependencies in order to realize specific benefits.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Portfolio &amp; Portfolio Management<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>a portfolio is a collection of projects or programs and other work that are grouped together. <\/em><\/strong>This is done to facilitate effective management of that work that will meet strategic business objectives. These projects or programs are not necessarily interdependent or directly related. This typically includes identifying, prioritizing and authorizing projects and programs to meet strategic business objectives.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Portfolio management is conventionally associated with financial strategies. Instead of<br \/>\r\nputting all their money in one place, organizations spread their money around and create a diverse portfolio of different types of investments such as stocks, bonds, small - cap, large - cap, domestic and international. They then manage the risk and returns in their portfolios by adjusting the mix and amount of investments, since it is unlikely that all these portfolios will go through a rise and fall simultaneously.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>For instance, organizations such as Google, Intuit, 3M, P&amp;G and Apple, who continually innovate, don&#39;t put all their money in one place. Instead they create diverse portfolios of innovation projects of different types, technologies and, markets. These companies then <strong>actively manage<\/strong> <strong>these portfolios<\/strong> by allocating resources differentially i.e. periodically killing some projects while doubling down on others.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Conversely there are many organizations who struggle with innovation since they do not manage their portfolio of projects well enough, allowing poorly performing projects to continue while starving those which have more potential.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Portfolio management<\/strong> involves the alignment with organizational strategies by the selection of the right programs or projects, prioritization of the work and allocation of the needed resources to programs and projects.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Portfolio Management Processes<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>a portfolio manager is able to manage his portfolios by using various portfolio management processes .Having a formal portfolio management process helps executives determine which projects most closely align with the organization&#39;s strategic goals, allows the organization to stage projects to avoid resource bottlenecks, and improves the vetting of proposed project requests that can be formally approved. A process within the context of portfolio management is a set of interrelated activities .These activities are performed by the portfolio manager to achieve a strategic element such as a goal, objective or action which will provide strategic planning benefits to the organization. Each process is characterized by its inputs, tools, and techniques that may be applied and the resulting outputs. Each portfolio manager is responsible for determining the processes which are appropriate for a given portfolio and their impact on the expected organizational results which are delivered by portfolio.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Roles of Project, Program and Portfolio managers<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>the roles of a Project manager, Program manager and a Portfolio manager may have some similarities but they are fundamentally different. Organizations who successfully deliver projects and programs that produce strategic business results are those who formalize these three distinct roles. They use the methodologies, processes, tools, and resources which are most appropriate for the function being performed.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nConversely, there are organizations that blend these roles together and treat them all as basic project management. This may help these organizations in reducing some overhead and bureaucracy, but eventually, this could result in failures. An excellent project manager may not necessarily be a good program manager or be capable of running the overall portfolio.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Therefore, let us now try and understand the roles of a project manager, a program manager and a portfolio manager; and understand how they are fundamentally different from each other.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Role of a Project manager <\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Project managers are responsible for implementing their projects within the desired schedule and budget and achieving the overall project objectives. They launch projects, establish and drive the project plan, monitor and assess risks and report the status of the project costs, quality and schedule, besides performing other activities which are related to managing their projects.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<strong>Role of a Program Manager<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Program managers have a broader view of the program than project managers do. They have to ensure that the overall business objectives are met by the benefits each project is supposed to realize.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<strong><em>Project managers are responsible for delivering those project benefits.<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The program manager is responsible for rolling up of information from each individual project and ensuring that the overall program is driven towards the project objectives.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<strong><em>Therefore projects managers are expected to manage their projects in a manner in which they integrate well in the overall program plan.<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The program manager is also responsible for tracking and analyzing the entire program.&nbsp; This also involves managing the collective risk for the entire program and not just for a single individual project.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Role of a Portfolio Manager <\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">A portfolio manager is responsible for identifying and prioritizing projects and programs as well as authorizing new ones. He performs these activities within the context of achieving the strategic business objectives. He allocates the needed resources to the project managers and program managers for the successful delivery of the projects and programs. He develops the frameworks and methodologies for managing the portfolios and ensures that infrastructure and systems to manage the portfolios are in place. He reviews all the reports that program managers submit to leverage economies of scale, reduce risks, and ensure that benefits being realized through each component are aligned to the organizational strategic goals and meet their key performance indicators like return on investment. He is also responsible for engaging the stakeholders to ensure that they all understand how the portfolios perform and the risks that they face.<\/span><\/span><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<strong>How do project, program and portfolio managers work together? <\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Portfolio managers, program managers and project managers depend upon one another in order to do their jobs successfully.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Project managers depend upon program managers and portfolio managers for the resources needed to deliver successful projects.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Program managers depend upon project managers for program deliverables and on portfolio managers for resources.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Portfolio managers provide resources to both project and program managers to facilitate their delivery on strategies. In turn portfolio managers depend upon program managers and on project managers to provide accurate progress reports and to deliver on strategic initiatives.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>IT portfolio Management <\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>There are many other areas where portfolio management can be applied including IT investments.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">At its most mature level, IT Portfolio management is accomplished by the following types of portfolio management.<\/span><\/span><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<strong>Project Portfolio Management (PPM)<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In this type of portfolio management , an organization analyzes and collectively manages a group of current or proposed projects based on certain criteria such as strategic value, impact on resources, cost etc. While doing so, the PMO&#39;s of organizations makes use of a centralized management of processes, methods and technologies. The objective of PPM is to allow the portfolio owner to determine the optimal resource mix for delivery and to schedule activities in a manner in which an organization&#39;s operational and financial goals could be achieved.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>PPM provides a lot of benefits to its users including effective management of time , resources , skills and budgets ; proper identification of the most suitable approach to deliver projects and programs , and a framework for issue resolution and risk mitigation etc.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Application portfolio Management<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In this type of portfolio management, an organization compares its spending&rsquo;s, based on their relative value. The comparison is based on a lot of tangible and non-tangible factors including profitability of the IT investments, the users&#39; familiarity with applications and infrastructure, obsolescence of old technologies and emergence of new ones, and an organizations experience with a certain technology.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Infrastructure Portfolio Management<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Infrastructure Management involves the management of essential operation components such as equipment, data, human resources, processes, policies etc. Many organizations neglect infrastructure management, resulting in cost overruns, overpayments, and failures.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Conclusion <\/strong><br \/>\r\nThe roles of a Project manager, Program manager and a Portfolio manager may have some similarities but they are fundamentally different. Organizations who successfully deliver projects and programs that produce strategic business results are those who formalize these three distinct roles and use the methodologies, processes, tools, and resources which are most appropriate for the function being performed.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe concept of portfolio management could be applied to IT investments as well. By managing IT investments as a portfolio of financial investments, risk and returns could be optimized, and assets could be allocated. At its most mature level, IT portfolio management could be accomplished through Project Portfolio Management, Application Portfolio Management and Infrastructure Portfolio Management.<\/p>","h1Tag":"Project Portfolio Management \u2013 An Overview","url":"resources\/project-management-articles\/project-portfolio-management-an-overview-rar88","status":"1","image_url":"http:\/\/cfs22.simplicdn.net\/ice9\/free_resources_article_thumb\/freeresources_517e742c78698.jpg","created_at":"2012-01-19T00:00:00+00:00","updated_at":null,"infographic_url":null,"thumbnail_url":"NULL","shares":0,"likes":0,"comments":0,"engagement_score":0,"segments":[],"skills":[],"tags":[],"id":"56dfb0f1ac530efd098b45a8"},{"course_id":[],"type":"article","label_id":"1","vertical":null,"name":"Project Time Management and its Significance in Business","display_name":"Project Time Management and its Significance in Business","author_name":null,"author_description":null,"author_image":null,"author_linkedin_profile":null,"author_twitter_profile":null,"short_description":null,"article_content":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">According to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/resources\/project-management-articles\/pmbok-a-guide-to-project-management-body-of-knowledge-rar73\">PMBOK Guide<\/a>, there are nine knowledge areas in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/project-management\">project management<\/a> and project time management is one of the knowledge areas.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Network diagram is extensively used in the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/resources\/project-management-articles\/pmp-certification-exam-vital-concepts-of-project-time-management-rar246\">Project Time Management<\/a> Knowledge Area to plot the activity dependencies.

These deliverables are derived from a project&rsquo;s requirements. It is the decision of what work will be completed during the lifecycle of a project. Included in this is also the identification of work that will not be counted in the ongoing round of the service\/product development.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nUnder Project Scope management are three processes. The planning process is when the outputs are created that work to capture and define the work that needs competition.&nbsp; The controlling and monitoring processes are concerned with documenting tracking, scope creep, tracking, and disapproving\/ approving project changes. The final process, closing includes an audit of the project deliverables and assess the outcomes against the original plan.<\/div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"text-align:center\"><br \/>\r\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/cfs22.simplicdn.net\/ice9\/free_resources_article_thumb\/PSM_question_2.jpg\" style=\"width: 550px; height: 94px;\" \/><\/div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\">The scope of a project is the clear identification of the work that is required to successfully complete or deliver a project.&nbsp; One of the project manager&rsquo;s responsibilities is to ensure that only the required work (the scope) will be performed and that each of the deliverables can be completed in the allotted time and within budget.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe documentation of the scope of the project will explain the boundaries of the project, establish the responsibilities of each member of the team and set up procedures for how work that is completed will be verified and approved.&nbsp; This documentation may be referred to as the scope statement, or the statement of work, or terms of reference.<\/div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"text-align:center\"><br \/>\r\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/cfs22.simplicdn.net\/ice9\/free_resources_article_thumb\/PSM_question_3.jpg\" style=\"width: 550px; height: 161px;\" \/><\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Steps involved in Project Scope Management<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n\r\n<div>As a project manager, you&#39;ll need to define project scope no matter what methodology you choose to use.<\/div>\r\n\r\n<h4>Define the needs<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<div>Defining the needs of the project is the first step towards the establishment of a project timeline, allocation project resources and setting project goals. Only with these steps defined, will you be able to understand the work that needs to be done &ndash; in other words, the scope of the project needs to be defined. Once that is done, team members can be allocated tasks, and the direction to which they need to work towards to deliver a project in the given time and budget.<\/div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"text-align:center\"><br \/>\r\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/cfs22.simplicdn.net\/ice9\/free_resources_article_thumb\/PSM_question_4.jpg\" style=\"width: 550px; height: 94px;\" \/><\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n\r\n<h4>Understand the project objectives<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<div>To define the project scope, it is important to first establish the objectives of the project, which may include a new product, creating a new service within the organization, or develop a new piece of software. There are a number of objectives that could be central to a project and it becomes the role of the project manager to ensure that the team delivers that result according to the specified features or functions.<\/div>\r\n\r\n<h4>How do you define the project scope?<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<div>The resources and the work that is put into the creation of a product or service is essentially the ones that frame the scope of the project. The scope generally outlines the goals to be met to achieve a satisfactory result. It is important for project managers to understand how to define the scope of the project.<\/div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"text-align:center\"><br \/>\r\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/cfs22.simplicdn.net\/ice9\/free_resources_article_thumb\/PSM_question_5.jpg\" style=\"width: 550px; height: 129px;\" \/><\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n\r\n<h4>Steps for defining the scope of a project<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<div>To define the scope of the project, it is important to identify the following:<\/div>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Project objectives<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Goals<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Sub-phases<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Tasks<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Resources<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Budget<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Schedule<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<div>Once these parameters are established, the limitations and parameters of the project need to be clarified and identify the aspects that are not to be included in the project. When doing this, the project scope will make clear to the stakeholders, senior management and team members what will and will not be included in the final product or service.<\/div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"text-align:center\"><br \/>\r\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/cfs22.simplicdn.net\/ice9\/free_resources_article_thumb\/PSM_question_6.jpg\" style=\"width: 550px; height: 140px;\" \/><\/div>\r\n\r\n<div>Along with this the scope of the project must have a tangible objective for the organization that is undertaking the project.

The PMBOK Guide, Fifth Edition, adds several processes to separate the initial planning activities from other activities.&nbsp; This process created the scope management plan. The scope management plan describes the project scope and documents how it will be further defined, validated, and controlled.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe table below shows the Inputs, Tools and Techniques, and Outputs of the Plan Scope Management Process.<\/div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"text-align:center\"><br \/>\r\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/cfs22.simplicdn.net\/ice9\/free_resources_article_thumb\/PSM_table_7.jpg\" style=\"width: 671px; height: 367px;\" \/><\/div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\">The Scope management plan involves how the scope will be defined, validated and controlled. It also includes how to prevent and deal with the scope creep, handling of the change requests, the escalation path for any disagreement on the scope elements between the stakeholders, the process for the creation of the scope statement, the WBS, and how the deliverables will be accepted.<\/div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"text-align:center\"><br \/>\r\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/cfs22.simplicdn.net\/ice9\/free_resources_article_thumb\/PSM_question_7.jpg\" style=\"width: 550px; height: 122px;\" \/><\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n\r\n<h4>Collect Requirements<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<div>This process involves the documentation of the stakeholders needs with the intention of meeting the project objectives.&nbsp;During this process managers seek to use multiple techniques and tools for the collection of the project requirements from the stakeholders. The process attempts to leave no stone unturned resulting an in depth list of project requirements. If this process if performed thoroughly and correctly, it reduces the number of surprises as the project moves towards completion.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe table below shows the Inputs, Tools and Techniques and the Outputs of the Collect Requirements process.<\/div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"text-align:center\"><br \/>\r\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/cfs22.simplicdn.net\/ice9\/free_resources_article_thumb\/PSM_table_2.jpg\" style=\"width: 671px; height: 465px;\" \/><\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n\r\n<h4>Define Scope<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<div>This process involves the defining of a detailed description of the project and its major deliverables.<br \/>\r\nThe next step is to define the scope. This process clearly states what the project is supposed to and what it cannot accomplish. The supporting documents are reviewed ensuring that the project will work up to the stated goals. The resulting scope will then state the stakeholder&rsquo;s needs and communicate the expectations for the performance of the project.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe table below shows the Inputs, Tools and Techniques and the Outputs of the Defining process.<\/div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"text-align:center\"><br \/>\r\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/cfs22.simplicdn.net\/ice9\/free_resources_article_thumb\/PSM_table_3.jpg\" style=\"width: 671px; height: 315px;\" \/><\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n\r\n<h4>Create Work Breakdown Structure<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<div>The Work Breakdown Structure(WBS) is an important part of the Scope management process and the PMI stresses on this point as many managers skip this step which leads to inaccurate plans. The WBS provides the project manager and his team with the opportunity to break down a high level scope statement to a smaller, manageable units of work, called work packages. The resulting WBS should provide a complete list of all work packages required to complete the project<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe table below shows the Inputs, Tools and Techniques and the Outputs of the WBS process.<\/div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"text-align:center\"><br \/>\r\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/cfs22.simplicdn.net\/ice9\/free_resources_article_thumb\/PSM_table_4.jpg\" style=\"width: 671px; height: 315px;\" \/><\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n\r\n<h4>Scope Verification<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<div>The Validate Scope process, focuses mainly on customer acceptance. It is when the project customer formally accepts all the project deliverables. This process occurs at the end of each phase. During the process, the customer gives their feedback on the work that was performed.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe table below shows the Inputs, Tools and Techniques and the Outputs of the Scope Verification process.<\/div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"text-align:center\"><br \/>\r\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/cfs22.simplicdn.net\/ice9\/free_resources_article_thumb\/PSM_table_5.jpg\" style=\"width: 671px; height: 315px;\" \/><\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n\r\n<h4>Scope control<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\r\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\">The control scope process involves the monitoring of the status of the project and the managing of the scope changes.<\/div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"text-align:center\"><br \/>\r\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/cfs22.simplicdn.net\/ice9\/free_resources_article_thumb\/PSM_table_6.jpg\" style=\"width: 671px; height: 405px;\" \/><\/div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\">This process involves the assessing of the additional requirements by the customer or proactively overlooking the project scope.&nbsp; Managers will measure the work product against the scope baseline to ensure that the project stays on track, and prevent any unnecessary changes.<\/div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\"><br \/>\r\nThe table above shows the Inputs, Tools and Techniques and the Outputs of the Scope Control process.<\/div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"text-align:center\"><br \/>\r\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/cfs22.simplicdn.net\/ice9\/free_resources_article_thumb\/PSM_question_8.jpg\" style=\"width: 550px; height: 155px;\" \/><br \/>\r\n&nbsp;<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n\r\n<h2>Common problems with Project Scope Management to avoid<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<div>Often, project managers bump into issues along the way. The problems that may arise with Project Scope are:<\/div>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li><strong>Ambiguous<\/strong>: Ambiguity in scope often leads to unnecessary work and confusion. To avoid this, the scope needs to be clearly defined and to the point.<\/li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Incomplete<\/strong>: Incomplete scopes lead to schedule slips which lead to cost overrun. To avoid this, the scope needs to be complete and accurate.<\/li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Transient<\/strong>: Transient scopes lead to scope creep which is the primary cause of late deliveries and potentially &quot;never ending&quot; projects. To avoid this, the scope document needs to be finalized and remain unaltered for the duration of the project.<\/li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Un-collaborative<\/strong>: A scope that is not collaborated leads to misinterpretations in requirements and design. To avoid this, the scope document should be shared with all stakeholders.<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<div style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/cfs22.simplicdn.net\/ice9\/free_resources_article_thumb\/PSM_question_9.jpg\" style=\"width: 550px; height: 109px;\" \/><\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n\r\n<h2>Why project&nbsp;managers needs it<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<div>Effective scope management requires communication to be good and clear, as this ensures that members on the team understand the scope of the project, while agreeing on how the project goals will be met.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nScope management helps avoid the challenges that a project might face with every growing scope and unruly requirement list. Project scope defines what is or is not included in the project, and controls what gets added or removed as the project is executed. Scope management establishes control processes to address factors that may result in project change during the project life-cycle.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nWithout defining the project scope, the cost or time that the project will take up cannot be estimated. At times, due to the lack of communication, scopes may need change. This directly effects the cost and disturbs the schedule of the project which in turn leads to losses.<\/div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"text-align:center\"><br \/>\r\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/cfs22.simplicdn.net\/ice9\/free_resources_article_thumb\/PSM_question_10.jpg\" style=\"width: 550px; height: 124px;\" \/><\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n\r\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<div>Scope management is a possible mission.

It has been done by simply raising the standards of quality through implementation of a methodical quality management approach. <strong>Quality system<\/strong> suggested by <strong>Six Sigma<\/strong> has created quite a buzz in almost every industry including healthcare, retail, BPO etc. Such state-of-the-art methods are developed with the sole objective of testing the important products and services to&nbsp; ensure that they are fulfilling the criteria of desired standards and customer&rsquo;s expectations pertaining to the products are successfully met. With the ever increasing demand of quality products, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/quality-management\/six-sigma-green-belt-training\"><strong>Six Sigma quality management <\/strong><\/a>has become the prime concern for organizations all over the world for survival and profitability.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<strong>Six Sigma<\/strong> Green Belt approach is not only about ensuring <strong>quality in production<\/strong>, but also about promising and delivering quality. Promising quality is all about assuring the vital customers that the services and products being provided are of best quality. For delivering quality consistently, it is of paramount importance to adapt to the industry-approved testing techniques and methodologies. It is the job of quality assurance office to look after all such aspects of product development and deliver excellence. Let&rsquo;s have a look at the roles and responsibilities <strong>of a quality assurance<\/strong> officer-<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Roles and Responsibilities of Quality Assurance Officer <\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>He is responsible to ensure the quality of products and services; and thereby take care of the entire process of QA in software development cycle.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>It is a quality assurance officer&rsquo;s lookout to maintain the high standards of a product or service.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>One of the most important responsibilities is that he has to improve the already set QA standards that are already set.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>He is also responsible to over-view sales statistics and check out the possible drops in sales because of not-so-good quality of products and services.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>It is the responsibility of the QA officer to make sure that the definition of quality is understood by all the employees to achieve the common goal.<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n\r\n<p>With the passage of time, the quality assessment and testing techniques have undergone revolutionary changes. Therefore, it becomes crucial for a QA office to stay current and updated with the recent product launches, seminars and workshops in quality management domain. This practice can play a good role in maintaining the technical knowledge and keep up with the rapidly growing <strong>QA standards<\/strong>. Often people consider quality control and <strong>quality assurance<\/strong> the same. In reality, there is a subtle difference in both the methods. As per the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/quality-management-system-impact-in-organizations-rar96-article\"><strong>quality management system<\/strong><\/a> experts, quality control has more emphasis on the product concerned. On the other hand, QA is all about focusing on the process of developing it.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Difference between Quality Control and Quality Assurance <\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>Quality Control <\/strong><\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Well... <a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/resources\/quality-management-articles\">quality control<\/a> is considered as a system. It is comprised of routine processes and activities, which are specifically aimed to measure and control the overall quality of the concerned product and service. It also involves accuracy check to ensure zero-error in data calculations and estimating the uncertainties. The quality assurance check should be regular. This is how the QC system can ensure data correctness, completeness and also the integrity. One major part of QC is to distinguish errors and rectify them.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>Quality Assurance<\/strong><\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>As mentioned above QA is a process, which is executed to meet the expectations of customers. There is a set of steps which are followed in order to attain the quality management goals. <strong>Six Sigma<\/strong> QA approach and <strong>quality infrastructure<\/strong> are gaining sky rocketing popularity in this domain as it is known to make use of a planned and systematic process for quality checks. It is done to prevent defects.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nToday, a lot of emphasis is laid and will continue to be laid, on the pursuit of perfection, to improve quality. Ideally, businesses are heading towards a zero-defect world. In achieving this perfection, a quality assurance officer will play a crucial part, directly or indirectly.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Conclusion<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Nowadays, every individual and business is on a constant pursuit of perfection. Hence, lot of emphasis is laid on quality of products and services delivered. There will be no exaggeration in stating that the modern business is naturally heading to a world with zero-defect.

No one can deny the significant influence of Six Sigma on quality management approach, theories and applications. Well, over time, quality management has evolved as one individual and mature field in corporates. It has sound definitional and conceptual foundations. Being an organized and systematic method for process improvement, Six Sigma has become the first choice of leading <strong>quality management organizations<\/strong>. This methodology has tremendous potential to reduce the customer defined defect rates. This is why it can outlast the traditional &lsquo;<strong>total quality management system&rsquo;<\/strong>. The pioneer of this extremely powerful quality control method has achieved a near-perfect business process and reduced the number of defects to a great extent.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Initially, Six Sigma <strong>quality management system<\/strong> was employed in the manufacturing sector only. But today, it plays an important role in the service sector too. This growth speaks volumes about the efficiency, which Six Sigma approach brings in for organizations. With the Six Sigma <strong>quality management system example<\/strong>, it has proved the versatility and compatibility of this process improvement method. One thing why this methodology is being welcomed in varied sectors is that it helps to locate the root cause of the deviation in the quality. However, it calls for a dedicated team of experts to implement it in a successful manner. The role of each team member should be well-defined at the initial stage itself. This practice makes sure that there is no dilution of Six Sigma <strong>quality management system<\/strong> principles and quality standards at the time of implementation.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>Is it possible to integrate Six Sigma with other Management Programs?<\/strong><\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Thanks to the state-of-the-art tools and techniques that were developed over the last couple of years, as they made it possible to integrate Six Sigma with other management programs. The best part is that the basic and fundamental concept of this method remains the same even with other programs. The way the <strong>quality management system<\/strong> is used only gets changed. There are a lot of similarities between the Six Sigma and the management framework, which enables this type of integration.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>Can Six Sigma outlast the total quality management system?<\/strong><\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>It would not be wrong to call Six Sigma a revolution in the world of <strong>total quality management system<\/strong>. This outstanding quality management method has indeed brought amazing improvements and value for businesses. TQM is known to be an effective approach when it comes to quality management.

Well, Six Sigma commons some cultural methodologies of TQM approach. It has been observed that TQM quality improvement initiatives reach a plateau after some point of time whereas Six Sigma takes it to another level. Therefore, it can be said that Six Sigma quality has all it takes to outlast the <strong>total quality management system<\/strong>.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>Special aspects of Six Sigma<\/strong><\/h4>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Being fact based and data driven has got astronomically high popularity for the Six Sigma quality management approach.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>This quality management system is not only result-oriented but has the potentials to get quantifiable as well as measurable bottom-line results.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>You can call it a leader-sponsored top-down approach for quality management.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>It gives proper attention to the customer requirements.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Most importantly, this approach can be applied to various business processes including administration, marketing, sales, Research &amp; Development etc.<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>Requirement of Six Sigma Quality Management System Training<\/strong><\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>With the amazing success rate of Six Sigma, more and more people are looking forward for a dependable and efficacious <a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/quality-management\/six-sigma-green-belt-training\">Six Sigma <strong>certification training<\/strong><\/a>.

In today&rsquo;s competitive scenario, ISO compliance or Six Sigma Quality Management is not a matter of choice for any organization to stay in the game.&nbsp;International Organization for Standardization (ISO)&nbsp;accreditation is an organization that provides a distinct edge to compaines for International business presence as well as ensuring customers&rsquo; confidence in the business.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nNeedless to say, this compliance can add value to the business. ISO 9000 (one of the widely recognized&nbsp;Quality standards&nbsp;in the world) is considered a way to increase the Quality of products and services. The sole aim of ISO 9000 is to embed an efficient Quality Management system in an organization which eventually can help increase productivity, reduce unwanted costs, and make sure utmost Quality of process and products. In the ISO 9000 family, there are various standards such as:<\/span><\/h2>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>ISO 9001: 2008<\/li>\r\n\t<li>ISO 9000: 2005<\/li>\r\n\t<li>ISO 9004: 2009<\/li>\r\n\t<li>ISO 19011:2011<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n\r\n<p>However, Six Sigma has emerged as a better approach to improve the&nbsp;Quality standards&nbsp;in previous years. &nbsp;Over the period time, it has become the most trusted&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/quality-management-system-impact-in-organizations-rar96-article\" title=\"Quality Management System\">Quality Management System<\/a>&nbsp;(QMS) across the world. At times, it is hard to choose between ISO 9000 and Six Sigma to achieve the&nbsp;Quality standards&nbsp;goals. Let&rsquo;s take a look at both the approaches to zero in on a proper technique of Quality Management.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2>ISO 9000 Approach<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The major emphasis of this Quality management method is to set&nbsp;Quality standards. There isn&rsquo;t a lot of fuss to improve the Quality of products and services. An ISO complied company is always governed by eight Quality principles of ISO 9000 and also adheres to the mentioned requirements.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nPrioritizing the customer data, purchasing and managing the Quality systems is considered as the most critical ISO 9000 principles. On the other hand, the ISO 9000 process doesn&rsquo;t leave much scope for innovative and fruitful alterations. It is all about &lsquo;what should be done&rsquo; instead of understanding the business improvement potentials.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Six Sigma Approach<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<p>It is popularly known to be as a data-drive and fact based approach for Quality management. The advantageous bit to this methodology is that it improves Quality by analyzing existing process and identifying the changes required to better the Quality of products and services. As per the industry experts, Six Sigma&nbsp;Quality Management System&nbsp;stresses on continuous improvement in Quality. It is achieved by the methodical use of statistical tools and techniques.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThere are multiple goals and objectives in Six Sigma Quality management projects. Therefore, it becomes vital to break the entire project into smaller and easily manageable projects, which are then subdivided, internally. The successful implemention of Six Sigma to meet the set&nbsp;Quality standards&nbsp;can only be done by&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/quality-management\/lean-six-sigma-black-belt-training-bangalore\/pct47co42\" title=\"Black Belt Certified\">Black Belt certified<\/a>&nbsp;professionals.

Verification gives the answer to the question whether the software is being developed in a correct way and validation provides the answer whether the right software is being produced. In a nutshell, verification denotes precision whereas validation indicates value of the end or final product<strong>. Verification and validation<\/strong> is an important step used in various processes in different industries.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Importance of Validation <\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Validation is requisite in the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/quality-management\/\">quality management<\/a> process. It makes sure that the process or product meets the purpose intended. There are different categories of validation in general described below-<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Prospective Validation <\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This type of validation is done to ensure the characteristics of interest before the product gets launched. Proper functioning of the product meeting the safety standards is also checked in the process of validation.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Retrospective Validation<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This kind of validation is done against the written specifications. Retrospective validation is actually based on the historical data or evidence that had been documented.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Partial Validation <\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This kind of validation is commonly used in research and pilot studies. &nbsp;During this process the most important effects get tested.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Periodical Validation<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>There are certain items of interest that at times get repaired, relocated, dismissed or integrated in specified time laps. This kind of validation is carried out for such items.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Concurrent Validation<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This kind of validation process I usually carried out during the routine service, manufacturing or engineering processing.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Cross Validation<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This type of validation technique is suitable for estimation of performance of a predictive model in statistics.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Verification and Validation in Software Development <\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/quality-management\/six-sigma-green-belt-training\">Six Sigma<\/a> initiatives deserve all the accolades for bringing the <strong>verification and validation<\/strong> aspects in the picture with Design for Six Sigma model. Before use or release, Design for Six Sigma is utilized to make products and processes perfect. It is actually an application of Six Sigma principles in order to design the products and also look after the manufacturing and support process. For better understanding, let&rsquo;s have a look at key Six Sigma methodologies.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>DMAIC Methodology <\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>D<\/strong>efine the problem or the project goals<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>M<\/strong>easure the problem<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A<\/strong>nalyze the data and process<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>I<\/strong>mprove the process<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>C<\/strong>ontrol<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>DMADV Methodology <\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>D<\/strong>efine the problem or the project goals<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>M<\/strong>easure and determine needs of customer<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A<\/strong>nalyze the process in order to meet the goals<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>D<\/strong>esign a process to serve the purpose<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>V<\/strong>erify the design performance<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>DFSS Methodology (Design for Six Sigma)<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>It has following steps for quality management &ndash;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>D<\/strong>efine<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>I<\/strong>dentify<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>D<\/strong>esign<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>O<\/strong>ptimize<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>V<\/strong>erify<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>What makes DFSS different from DMAIC is the <strong>verification and validation<\/strong> part. It can successfully get applied to Software Engineering as the methodology can cover the overall Software Development Cycle. The major emphasis of DFSS is on designing and re-designing the services or products and making them ready for the commercial market.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Eliminate defects with Verification and Validation <\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The word &lsquo;defects&rsquo; is very dangerous for the software development processes. Defects are something that is not right with the product or services. Therefore, it becomes highly essential to keep the defect at a bay during the software development process, and Design for Six Sigma helps to eliminate the defects. The objective is to pursue continuing process improvement by verifying and validating the processes. Six Sigma quality management methods offer a methodical way to figure out the defects and aid to rectify them accordingly. It is an approach to achieve quality level of zero defects.<\/p>","h1Tag":null,"url":"resources\/quality-management-articles\/verification-and-validation-in-software-quality-management-rar100","status":"1","image_url":"http:\/\/cfs22.simplicdn.net\/ice9\/free_resources_article_thumb\/freeresources_517e772dd9c11.png","created_at":"2012-03-21T00:00:00+00:00","updated_at":null,"infographic_url":null,"thumbnail_url":"NULL","shares":0,"likes":0,"comments":0,"engagement_score":0,"segments":[],"skills":[],"tags":[],"id":"56dfb0f1ac530efd098b45b4"},{"course_id":["148"],"type":"article","label_id":"5","vertical":"business","name":"Strategic Enterprise Management And Its Components","display_name":"Strategic Enterprise Management And Its Components","author_name":"Eshna Verma","author_description":"Eshna is a writer at Simplilearn.

An organization is comprised of various departments who work together to achieve the organization&rsquo;s set goal. The HR department hires professionals and defines their jobs, the payroll department manages the payment structure of employees, the sales department manages the sales and distribution process, the production department manages the inputs and outputs of a production, the finance department handles money involved across departments and so on.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThere are marketing teams who handle the promotional and marketing activities of an organization, the IT team handles the information server and security, the development team takes care of the website, the content team generates the content and more.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThus, there are a host of diverse departments that run an organization. Few of the listed can be eliminated based on the industry, and few are fixed departments within an organization across industries. Individual departments can be handled manually but when it comes to organizing and handling a complete Enterprise Management, things become different.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe task of managing departments at an enterprise level is very complex and the complexity increases along with the organization size. In order to simplify the processes and to manage diverse departmental data and work process, the Enterprise Management solutions (ERP) emerged.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nWhen started,&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/erp-planning-and-erp-systems-rar102-article\">ERP systems&nbsp;<\/a>were focused to Enterprise Management for bigger organizations but over the years, small and medium size companies too adopted ERP solutions. There are many market leaders providing ERP software development solutions and SAP is one of the pioneers. SAP offers strategic Enterprise Management solutions for different process and areas in enterprises.\r\n<h2>What is Strategic Enterprise Management?<\/h2>\r\nSAP Strategic Enterprise Management is a solution that was developed towards building an integrated system to manage diverse processes within an organization. The major goal is to integrate a single unified system to record each move of a department through organizing, planning, executing and controlling processes.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nDifferent Enterprise Management solutions are developed to support different departmental objectives such as HCM in Enterprise Management, SD in Enterprise Management, FI in Enterprise Management and so on. HCM in Enterprise Management involves all the tasks coming under human capital management in the HR. Right from hiring employees to managing the employee&rsquo;s lifecycle within an organization, everything is handled by this system.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nSD in Enterprise Management works towards managing the sales data and distribution details of an organization. On the other hand, FI in Enterprise Management manages the money involved in various departments in an organization. There are more strategic Enterprise Management solutions such as materials management, customer relationship management etc., developed by SAP for enterprises.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe aim behind developing Strategic Enterprise Management is to generate extension to the primary Enterprise Management systems based on in depth work processes such as risk management, strategy planning, performance monitoring, and communications management and so on. SAP Strategic Enterprise Management aims to deliver quick implementation of fresh solutions.\r\n<h2>Components of SAP Strategic Enterprise Management<\/h2>\r\n<strong>Business Planning and Simulation<\/strong><strong>:<\/strong>&nbsp;One of the reasons behind developing Strategic Enterprise Management solution is to monitor and manage the performance level of an organization. SAP SEM allows simulation tools to track business performance that helps in future planning and simulation of businesses.<br \/>\r\n<strong>Business Consolidation<\/strong><strong>:<\/strong>&nbsp;This enables functionality for legally required consolidation by a particular organization. However, management consolidations can be based on diverse organizational units and roles.<br \/>\r\n<strong>Business Information Collection<\/strong><strong>:<\/strong>&nbsp;This enables a department to collect detailed business information. Tiny details of each process can be tracked and recorded in a unified system that enhances future reference and work management.<br \/>\r\n<strong>Corporate Performance Monitor:<\/strong>&nbsp;As the term suggests, it is about monitoring the performance of corporate solutions. The best practice under the corporate performance monitor is using a feedback form from business execution systems to measure the performance level.<br \/>\r\n<strong>Stakeholder Relationship Management:<\/strong>&nbsp;Success of a project lies in strong and clear interaction between all the stakeholders. The SAP SEM system enables the managing of a unified interacting system where every stakeholders group participates and are aware of movements within organizations.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThus, SAP Strategic Enterprise Management makes sure that the performance of a business is measured using different methods based on which the future business plan is strategically built. Thus SAP Strategic Enterprise Management is an effective way to strengthen IT infrastructure to maximize business performance.","h1Tag":"Strategic Enterprise Management and its Components","url":"resources\/sap-certification-articles\/strategic-enterprise-management-and-its-components-rar101","status":"1","image_url":"http:\/\/cfs22.simplicdn.net\/ice9\/free_resources_article_thumb\/freeresources_517e778613db5.png","created_at":"2012-02-12T00:00:00+00:00","updated_at":null,"infographic_url":null,"thumbnail_url":"NULL","shares":0,"likes":0,"comments":0,"engagement_score":0,"segments":[],"skills":[],"tags":[],"id":"56dfb0f1ac530efd098b45b5"},{"course_id":["38"],"type":"article","label_id":"5,6","vertical":"business","name":"Enterprise Resource Planning and ERP Systems","display_name":"Enterprise Resource Planning and ERP Systems","author_name":"Chandana","author_description":"Chandana is working as a Senior Content Writer in Simplilearn.com and handles variety of creative writing jobs.

","article_content":"<h3 style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Enterprise Resource Planning<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Enterprise Resource Planning or ERP, is a term used to define software packages which are designed to support various business functions and objectives. The ERP system generally includes software systems on manufacturing, order entry, warehouse management, transportation, sales and distribution and more. From the time the computer was invented, there have been continuous processes moving towards improving work experience and lifestyle using the information system and ERP solutions makes an attempt to do the same.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nERP in simple terms is a method to integrate various processes and data within a single unified system. There are many enterprise resource planning systems offered by various pioneer business enterprises towards achieving organized structure and maintenance of databases across departments in organizations. Now, let us identify few facts about ERP and ERP implementation.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"text-decoration: underline\">ERP System over the years<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Invented in the year 1960, Enterprise Resource Planning Systems was concentrated on inventory control resulting in various ERP software solutions based on inventory control and management. Few years later, the focus shifted to manufacturing resources planning to organize distribution management activities in organizations.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nMany software solutions were developed that covered the areas of engineering, human resource management, sales and distribution, financial management, project management, customer relationship management and so on. It was then that the term Enterprise Resource Planning was coined owing to its growing relevancy across the enterprise requirements.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"text-decoration: underline\">ERP Implementation in Businesses<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>ERP was confined to only big businesses when it started, however, over the years, small and medium size companies too adopted ERP implementation. Corporations or organizations that manage a lot of data flowing can adopt ERP systems for better data management. There are different ERP solutions designed for different processes that run through in organizations.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe sales team can adopt ERP sales and distribution solutions to manage sales data in an organized way. The HR department can use HRM solution to maintain the human resource details including hiring, compensation, and payroll and so on. The finance department can use financial solutions in order to manage finances better in organizations.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThus, there are many ERP systems and solutions available for different processes in an organization. To implement an enterprise resource planning system, a careful design and structured operation is required. Ideally, smaller ERP systems take lesser time to be prepared as compared to larger ERP systems. Migration of data of a process to an ERP system is the most critical part in ERP implementation. There are few steps involved in migrating data to an ERP system:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Identifying the required data to be migrated<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Planning the time span for migration<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Building data templates<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Deciding on the data migration tools<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Selecting the data migration setups<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Archiving the required data<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<p>To master the ERP implementation, one requires both knowledge and hands on practice on enterprise resource solutions.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Merits and Demerits of Enterprise Resource Planning Systems<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The most striking advantage of implementing ERP systems is that data can be easily transferred from one place to another. Along with better data management, security of organization data is ensured with ERP. Other such benefits include swift recruitment process, fast customer delivery. One of the major disadvantages of ERP implementation is the cost. Also at times, the software is so complex that it consumes more time in operating the same.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"text-decoration: underline\">SAP ERP Solutions<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>There are different market leaders providing ERP solutions such as SAP&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/resources\/sap-technology-certification\/top-5-erp-solutions\">ERP solutions<\/a>, Oracle Corporation, Peoplesoft and more.

On the other hand departments like Financial Accounting, Sales Team, and Online Marketing Team etc., are industry specific departments unique to some enterprises. Every department has their own set of data and documents that the team members manage at department levels. However, to manage all these data of different departments at an enterprise level is a big challenge. To manage the entire data of an enterprise is very difficult manually. To make this possible, there are enterprise resources planning solutions developed for better work processes and data organizational management at an enterprise level. SAP is a market leader in providing <a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/erp-planning-and-erp-systems-rar102-article\">ERP systems<\/a>. SAP has solutions for different processes such as SAP HCM module for HR department, SAP SD module for Sales department, SAP FI module for Finance department, SAP MM module for Product team and so on. SAP implementation on different enterprise structures results differently. While smaller enterprises might not wish to invest heavily on an ERP solution, for larger enterprises it can be one of the biggest necessities. Let&rsquo;s identify the different types of enterprise structures and the impact of SAP implementation in the organizational structure in this post.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong><u>Major Types of Organizational Structure<\/u><\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Single Entity<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Partnership<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Limited Company<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Social Enterprise Company<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Single Entity:<\/strong> Running a business as a single entity comes under the legal organizational structure of sole trader. Such type of organizations are solely handled and managed by a single owner who invests money on it and is responsible for all profit or loss that comes as resultant. Setting up as a single entity is simpler than other enterprise structure. Loads of paper works, revenue division, accounting and business audits are eliminated from such types of enterprise structure. Being a sole trader, one will never require a SAP system to manage stuffs. However, things do not end as a sole trader. It continues to expand and making big. As the enterprise grows, the necessity for organizational management emerges. Being a sole trader, you will wish to track the entire processes of an enterprise through a unified system. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/sap-netweaver-and-its-components-rar112-article\">SAP NetWeaver<\/a> is the best option for sole trader as it manages different process through a single system and brings down cost of ownership.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Partnership:<\/strong> When two or more people run an organization, it is termed as partnership business. The amount of risks, investment, responsibilities, profit, loss and stakes are shared among the partners. The percentage of ownership varies based on different factors. There can be standard partnership, limited partnership and a limited liability partnership. For such an entity, enterprises can take up different SAP ERP system for different processes.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<strong>Limited Company:<\/strong> The legal organizational structure for limited company involves a lot of paper works and legal procedures. Such company&rsquo;s limits liability and the owner&rsquo;s personal assets are different from the company&rsquo;s finances. Limited companies are generally built up through venture capital investments made by individuals or organizations. Such types of company involves good number of employees and tasks such as payroll structure, time management, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/project-human-resource-management-rrt3co10vd36-video\">HR management <\/a>apart from other industry specific departments. SAP ERP solutions include software system for managing the data bases across different departments. SAP ERP system can be used for automatically tracking the payroll details, employee work timings and so on.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<strong>Social Enterprise Company: <\/strong>These types of companies are kind of limited companies that work for a social cause. The motive for working for a social cause is larger than profit making. At times social enterprise companies are much bigger in size and lots of legal data and processes need to be recorded. SAP systems serve good help in the thorough organizational management of such companies.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nSAP implementation is effective for every organization but the type of system adopted should fulfill their requirement. Bigger organizations can handle SAP systems for different process while smaller organizations can adopt SAP NetWeaver to manage different process from the same space. It depends on the amount of investment enterprises are willing to make and also as per their requirement.<br \/>\r\n&nbsp;<\/p>","h1Tag":"Enterprise Structures and SAP Implementation","url":"resources\/sap-certification-articles\/enterprise-structures-and-sap-implementation-rar103","status":"1","image_url":"http:\/\/cfs22.simplicdn.net\/ice9\/free_resources_article_thumb\/freeresources_517e77e09fd10.jpg","created_at":"2012-02-06T00:00:00+00:00","updated_at":null,"infographic_url":null,"thumbnail_url":"NULL","shares":0,"likes":0,"comments":0,"engagement_score":0,"segments":[],"skills":[],"tags":[],"id":"56dfb0f1ac530efd098b45b7"},{"course_id":["459","476","48"],"type":"article","label_id":"6","vertical":"technology","name":"HCM Reporting and Advantages of SAP HCM Reporting","display_name":"HCM Reporting and Advantages of SAP HCM Reporting","author_name":"Sivananda","author_description":"Sivananda is currently Senior Manager (Large Corporate) at Axis Bank, He is an FRM from Global Association of Risk Professionals (GARP), USA, and also a CFA.

SAP (Systems, Applications and Products) founded in the year 1972 in Germany is the trend of today&rsquo;s enterprise world. When <a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/resources\/sap-certification-articles\">SAP<\/a> started its journey, it was focused to inventory management. However, over the years various enterprise resource planning solutions on different areas has been adopted towards better data management in enterprises. SAP was confined to larger companies initially but gradually small and medium sized companies too adopted the technology solutions for better work management. SAP delivers software solutions that allow organizations to store data and records of different processes in a single unified system. Different ERP solutions based on diverse work areas such as human resource, financial accounting, payroll, time management and so on are developed by SAP. SAP NetWeaver as mentioned earlier is the latest developed SAP module. Every organization aims at managing well-structured data at an enterprise level. The major challenge here is to integrate the heterogeneous environment of an organization within a unified system and at the same time managing it at a lower cost. NetWeaver results as a solution to this challenge. SAP NetWeaver is developed as an Artificial Intelligence Shell. The primary aspect of AI shell is that it adopts standard comments literally as they are delivered by the users. Let&rsquo;s have a complete overview of SAP NetWeaver in this post.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><u>What is SAP NetWeaver?<\/u><\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/sap-implementation-and-enterprise-structures-rar103-article\">SAP NetWeaver<\/a>, launched in the year 2004, can be defined as a system that is a compilation of different properties that helps in managing different applications through a single system at a much lower cost. This unified system runs different data management processes through a single system and thereby cutting down costs to a significant extent. It can also be referred to as the consolidation of diverse data and processes. SAP NetWeaver has like modules in both SAP such as Business Intelligence (BI), Enterprise Portal (EP), Exchange Infrastructure (EI) and more. The sole aim of SAP NetWeaver is to deliver a unified tracking system for different processes. It is best for organizations who wish to merge their processes and manage it through a system. It allows users to create new applications along with migrating data from existing systems. SAP NetWeaver intake both regular and verbal instructions from users and thus is more user-friendly. Also this brings down the cost of investment on enterprise&rsquo;s part as the entire package of SAP NetWeaver comes in a lower cost of ownership. SAP NetWeaver makes businesses reliable along with building efficiency in processes. The implementation cost for SAP NetWeaver business client is significantly low because all the different processes are integrated and delivered by a single system developed by SAP.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><u>Multiple Components of SAP NetWeaver<\/u><\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>SAP Business Information Warehouse (BIW)<\/li>\r\n\t<li>SAP Enterprise Portal<\/li>\r\n\t<li>SAP Business Intelligence<\/li>\r\n\t<li>SAP XI Exchanging Infrastructure<\/li>\r\n\t<li>SAP Knowledge Warehouse (KW)<\/li>\r\n\t<li>SAP Master Data Management (MDM)<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<p>SAP Business Information Warehouse: As the term suggests, SAP BIW provides data warehouse functionality for businesses.

SAP was initially developed to manage inventory data. However over time, different modules of SAP were developed focusing on different areas of an organization. Today, there are SAP modules for almost all major departments in an organization. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/resources\/sap-certification-articles\/sap-human-capital-management-hcm-rar107\">SAP HCM module <\/a>is for the HR department, SAP SD module is apt for sales department, SAP FI is ideal for finance department, and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/sap-certification\/sap-mm-training\">SAP MM Certification<\/a> is for the product management department and so on. All these modules help different departments to manage work processes and data bases from a unified system. SAP was earlier adopted only by larger organizations but now days, owing to its benefits, even smaller to medium size organizations are adopting SAP modules in their process. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/resources\/sap-certification-articles\/sap-netweaver-and-its-components-rar112\">SAP NetWeaver<\/a> is an ERP system that helps organizations to manage data base for different processes from one system. It is the most effective and affordable SAP ERP software for smaller organizations and others who want to manage larger data base from a single system and cut down costs while enhancing the management process. &nbsp;Implementing SAP modules can be complex and one needs to have adequate knowledge and skills to do the same. Professionals need to have a good understanding of the SAP query tool in order to manage SAP systems in organizations. Let&rsquo;s understand what SAP query reporting is and how SAP query tool is implemented in organizations.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong><u>What is SAP Query?<\/u><\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>When organizations adopt SAP systems, many a times, the SAP users need to provide reports on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/resources\/sap-certification-articles\/enterprise-structures-and-sap-implementation-rar103\">SAP implementation<\/a> without getting any ABAP coding. It takes time to write coding in development. Firstly, one needs to write the code, transport and test it and thereafter transport it to production. All these processes take lot of time. In such cases, SAP query comes into the scene. SAP query is a tool generated by SAP that enables you to define and execute reports without knowing the APAB programming language. SAP query reporting is ideal for users who have little knowledge on APAB programming language and coding used in development. There are different components of SAP query tool with different features. Creation of lists, statistics and other lists, maintaining the InfoSets, the users groups, translation of query etc. are covered by the components of SAP query.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong><u>Five Components of SAP Query Tool<\/u><\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>Queries:<\/strong> Each components of SAP query too have sub components for different uses. Components of queries are executing queries and generating diverse lists. It allows users to define queries and change queries.<\/li>\r\n\t<li><strong>InfoSet Query:<\/strong> This component let you understand what fields of data source can be added on queries. InfoSets are usually assigned to user groups. End users can work on InfoSet queries, confining to only their specific area.<\/li>\r\n\t<li><strong>User Groups: <\/strong>This component is used to maintain different user groups. It allows system administrators to set up work environment for end-users.<\/li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Translation\/Query:<\/strong> This component displays the texts derived while generating queries, InfoSets and user groups in the language chose by the users.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong><u>Purpose of SAP Query Tool<\/u><\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>SAP query tool is designed to create quick reports that are not contained in the default. SAP query tool allows users to generate different types of reports such as basic lists, statistics and ranked lists. It provides broad ways of generating reports. Outputs of SAP query can be generated using table format, ALV grids, downloadable spreadsheets and flat files as well. The major purpose of building SAP query tool is to provide quick reports without knowing the APAB coding knowledge.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong><u>SAP Query Areas &ndash; Standard and Global <\/u><\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>Standard Area: <\/strong>SAP query standard area is client specific. Also query objects are not the connected to the Workbench organizer.<\/li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Global Area:<\/strong> Unlike standard area, SAP query global area is cross-functional. Also query objects are connected to the Workbench organizer.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong><u>SAP Query &ndash; Steps to Implement<\/u><\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Creating alerts on the basis of status<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Transporting SAP query for standard or global area from source system<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Maintaining query translation in a chose language<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Creating transactions for SAP query<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Creating Ad Hoc query<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Transporting SAP query objects<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Ensuring SAP query reporting<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<p>These are the basics on SAP query and its implementation on processes. SAP query helps in developing queries that can be used and distributed throughout the system.<br \/>\r\n&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<hr \/>\r\n<p>View our online SAP certification courses:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width: 213px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/sap-certification\/sap-mm-training-online\/ppa375\">SAP MM Online Training<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width: 213px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/sap-certification\/sap-sd-training-online\/ppa366\">SAP SD Online Training<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t<\/tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width: 213px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/sap-certification\/sap-fi-training\">SAP FI Online Training<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width: 213px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/sap-certification\/sap-co-training\">SAP CO Online Training<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t<\/tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width: 213px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/sap-certification\/sap-fico-training\">SAP FICO Online Training<\/a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width: 213px;\">&nbsp;<\/td>\r\n\t\t<\/tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width: 213px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/sap-certification\/sap-abap-training-online\/ppa618\">SAP ABAP Online<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width: 213px;\">&nbsp;<\/td>\r\n\t\t<\/tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width: 213px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/sap-certification\/sap-pm-training-online\/ppa386\">SAP PM Online Training<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width: 213px;\">&nbsp;<\/td>\r\n\t\t<\/tr>\r\n\t<\/tbody>\r\n<\/table>\r\n","h1Tag":null,"url":"resources\/sap-certification-articles\/sap-query-tool-and-its-components-rar113","status":null,"image_url":"http:\/\/cfs22.simplicdn.net\/ice9\/free_resources_article_thumb\/freeresources_517e79f1bc611.jpg","created_at":"2016-03-09T05:13:21+00:00","updated_at":null,"infographic_url":null,"thumbnail_url":"NULL","shares":0,"likes":0,"comments":0,"engagement_score":0,"segments":[],"skills":[],"tags":[],"id":"56dfb0f1ac530efd098b45c1"},{"course_id":[],"type":"article","label_id":"6","vertical":null,"name":"SAP Sales and Distribution, SAP SD Configuration and SAP SD User","display_name":"SAP Sales and Distribution, SAP SD Configuration and SAP SD User","author_name":"Eshna","author_description":"Eshna is a writer at Simplilearn.

An enterprise is comprised of different processes including HR management, finance management, sales management, admin management, payroll management and so on. It is very important to track the databases of each process at an enterprise level. To fulfill this requirement, SAP developed various software solutions serving diverse purposes. SAP ERP system initially was developed focusing on inventory management; however they gradually expanded and build up solutions around different processes to cope up with diverse data management requirements in organizations. SAP HCM, SAP FICO, SAP SD and more are some of the most popularly used SAP modules for human resource management, financial accounting and controlling and sales and distribution respectively. SAP modules are designed to integrate diverse external and internal data of an enterprise in a single unified system. There are different departments such as finance, HR, sales, manufacturing etc., and each department beholds good amount of data at the department levels. SAP provides modules to manage these data and processes at a process level and also at an enterprise level.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>SAP Time Management is a module under SAP Human Capital Management (HCM). SAP Time Management is extensively used by the human resources and admin departments in enterprises for better time tracking and management across departments. &nbsp;Time recording is one of the crucial requirements for every organization because along with work the amount of time invested is also important. As an example: Employee X completed a project, maintaining the quality in 1 week and Employee Y completed the same project with standard quality in 5 days. Therefore, Y performed better in that project. Another example can be cited of log in and log out details. If there is no time recording system in place for employees, there can be various instances where people might take advantage of the same. Most of the companies manage an 8-9 hours of working schedule per day for employees and following it is a mandate for all the employees. A tracking recording system in place helps you to record the timings for employees based on which other related tasks like compensation, payroll, incentives, OTs etc., are calculated. Let&rsquo;s have a look at some of the tasks that are managed by SAP Time Management.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><u>Features of SAP Time Management <\/u><\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Monitors Human Costs<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Documents Progress of Process<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Process of Invoices<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Records External Employees&rsquo; Services<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Confirms Service Management Orders<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Maintains Planning and Progress<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Collects Data Plans and Sheets<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<p>These are some of the most important features of SAP Time Management. As it manages the time invested by an employee on a particular project, it can monitor human costs and the status of profit or loss for the organization. Secondly, it tracks the progress of a process through a unified system so that all the stakeholders are aware of the project status. SAP Time Management improves the invoicing process by tracking the status of invoice submission, process and completion. This system also helps the organization to track the invested time and service from external employees. It enables to track the time span for managing a service order towards completing it. Further, it extracts the data that can be used for maintaining the planning and process of a project and reporting the same. Thus, SAP Time Management works effectively in handling multiple tasks across diverse projects.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><u>Advantages of SAP Time Management<\/u><\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Focus on employees and tasks<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Focus on users and tasks<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Effective time recording across processes<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Records incentives, compensation, appraisal terms and so on<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Tracks each change in a project<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Updates regular reports<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Simplifies analysis and reporting<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Tracks employee and project performance<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<p>These are some of the most striking benefits of SAP Time Management. These benefits help an organization, especially the human resource department to handle and manage work processes and employees in a definite manner. Master the skill of employee management by enrolling yourself into a training program on SAP HCM certification. There are few disadvantages as well of SAP Time Management such as that it can at times be costly for small businesses; customization can be complex for businesses having multiple departments and might end up with extra investment. To cope up with these disadvantages, professionals should be well trained in handling SAP systems. Therefore, SAP training is widely advised by experts to professionals towards managing SAP system for better data and work management in enterprises.<\/p>","h1Tag":null,"url":"resources\/sap-certification-articles\/sap-time-management-its-features-and-advantages-rar115","status":"1","image_url":"http:\/\/cfs22.simplicdn.net\/ice9\/free_resources_article_thumb\/freeresources_517e7a31f2d7b.png","created_at":"2013-01-31T00:00:00+00:00","updated_at":null,"infographic_url":null,"thumbnail_url":"NULL","shares":0,"likes":0,"comments":0,"engagement_score":0,"segments":[],"skills":[],"tags":[],"id":"56dfb0f1ac530efd098b45c3"},{"course_id":["10"],"type":"article","label_id":"1","vertical":"business","name":"Critical Path Method \u2013 Scheduling the Complex Projects","display_name":"Critical Path Method \u2013 Scheduling the Complex Projects","author_name":"Eshna","author_description":"Eshna is a writer at Simplilearn.

It is defined as the longest duration path through a network diagram and determines the shortest time to complete the project.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Float is another concept, which is quite important in understanding the critical path. Float is calculated once the network diagram is ready. There are three kind of float that can be calculated. The first is the Total Float, which denotes the amount of time an activity may be delayed without affecting the schedule of subsequent activities.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second type of float is Free Float which is the amount of time an activity can be delayed without delaying the early start date of its successor(s) activities.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The last type is Project Float which is the amount of time a Project can be delayed without delaying the externally imposed project completion date required by the customer or previously committed by the Project Manager. You can think of float as a cushion time available to complete an activity. Float is also called slack. Now, let me ask you. What is the slack of the activities on the critical path? The answer is Zero.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is no scope to delay activities in the critical path. Critical Path actually represents the Project duration. They actually add together to the Project duration, so where is the scope for the delay? Delaying activities on the critical path is as good as delaying the project duration!<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are two ways in which float of an activity can be calculated. But, before that, let me inform you that the first step in critical path method is to identify the Critical Path of the Network. Once the critical path is identified, calculate the start date and end date of each of the activities on the critical path.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>As we have seen earlier, the float of the activities on the critical path is zero so they represent the overall project duration. Now that you know the Project duration, you can either go through the network starting with time zero and keep on calculating the time required to complete each activity till you reach the last activity of the Project. This is also called Forward pass. The starting time for each activity in this approach is called &#39;Early Start&#39; and end time for each activity is called &#39;Early Finish&#39;.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Or you can travel through the network from the project end date and calculate the time required to complete each activity. This is called backward pass. The end date in this approach is called the Late Finish and the start date of the activity in this approach is called the Late Start.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The float of the activity is either the difference between the &#39;Late Start&#39; and &#39;Early Start&#39; or the difference between the &#39;Late Finish&#39; and &#39;Early Finish&#39;. Both the differences work out to be the same. In case you find it difficult to understand critical path, I suggest that you go through the last two slides twice and then look at the next slide where we have explained a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/pmp-risk-management-part-i-rar234-article\" title=\"Critical Path Example\">critical path example<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Insert Example Video<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&#39;s look at this example. There are basically&nbsp;five activities in this Project. If you look at the Network diagram, there are two paths in this Network. Start, 1, 2, 4, 5, End is one path and Start, 1, 3, 5, End is the second path. Since the duration of the path Start, 1, 2, 4, 5, End is 18 days, which is more than the duration of the path Start, 1, 3, 5, End.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The critical path of the Project is Start, 1, 2, 4, 5, End. Take some time to calculate all the four values, i.e. Early Start, Early Finish, Late start and late finish of the activities. I have written down the values for your verification.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let me take Activity 3 as an example.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nFirst we will calculate the Early Start and Early Finish dates. Activity 3 can start only after Activity 1. Since the Early finish of Activity 1 is 3, which becomes the Early Start of Activity 3.Activity 3 cannot start earlier than 3, because Activity 1 is getting completed only then. So, Early Start of Activity 3 is 3. Since the duration of the activity is 4 days. The Early Finish of Activity 3 is 3+4= 7 days. Now, let&#39;s calculate the late start and late finish of Activity 3.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nLate Start of Activity 5 is 14 days. The activity 3 happens just before Activity 5, so the Late Finish of Activity 3 is 14 days. To calculate the late start, you can subtract the duration from late finish. So the Late start of Activity 3 is 14-4=10.<br \/>\r\n&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<hr \/>\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 11pt; mso-ascii-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-hansi-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-bidi; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA;\"><font color=\"#000000\">We provide PMP classroom training in the following cities:<\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width: 213px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/project-management\/pmp-certification-training-albuquerque\/pct2288co10\">ALBUQUERQUE<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width: 213px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/project-management\/pmp-certification-training-fairbanks\/pct6731co10\">FAIRBANKS<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width: 213px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/project-management\/pmp-certification-training-kansas-city\/pct2163co10\">KANSAS CITY<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t<\/tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width: 213px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/project-management\/pmp-certification-training-baton-rouge\/pct3179co10\">BATON ROUGE<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width: 213px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/project-management\/pmp-certification-training-toronto\/pct2848co10\">TORONTO<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width: 213px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/project-management\/pmp-certification-training-prague\/pct3174co10\">PRAGUE<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t<\/tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width: 213px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/project-management\/pmp-certification-training-albany\/pct2805co10\">ALBANY<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width: 213px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/project-management\/pmp-certification-training-beijing\/pct19co10\">BEIJING<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width: 213px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/project-management\/pmp-certification-training-melbourne\/pct4co10\">MELBOURNE<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t<\/tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width: 213px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/project-management\/pmp-certification-training-manila\/pct15766co10\">MANILA<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width: 213px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/project-management\/pmp-certification-training-indianapolis\/pct2145co10\">INDIANAPOLIS<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width: 213px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/project-management\/pmp-certification-training-nashville\/pct2183co10\">NASHVILLE<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t<\/tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width: 213px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/project-management\/pmp-certification-training-edison\/pct4955co10\">EDISON<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width: 213px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/project-management\/pmp-certification-training-kuwait\/pct17243co10\">KUWAIT<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width: 213px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/project-management\/pmp-certification-training-tokyo\/pct8co10\">TOKYO<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t<\/tr>\r\n\t<\/tbody>\r\n<\/table>","h1Tag":null,"url":"resources\/project-management-articles\/critical-path-method-rar117","status":"1","image_url":"http:\/\/cfs22.simplicdn.net\/ice9\/free_resources_article_thumb\/freeresources_PMP-Critical_Path_Method_51976fd7d3917.jpg","created_at":"2012-01-23T00:00:00+00:00","updated_at":null,"infographic_url":null,"thumbnail_url":"NULL","shares":0,"likes":0,"comments":0,"engagement_score":0,"segments":[],"skills":[],"tags":[],"id":"56dfb0f1ac530efd098b45c4"},{"course_id":["10"],"type":"article","label_id":"1","vertical":"business","name":"Role of Earned Value Technique in Project Management","display_name":"Role of Earned Value Technique in Project Management","author_name":"Eshna","author_description":"Eshna is a writer at Simplilearn.

It&#39;s a method of objectively measuring project performance against the Project baseline. Result from an <a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/earned-value-management-and-its-significance-rar81-article\">Earned Value analysis<\/a> indicates deviation of the Project from cost and schedule baselines.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let me quickly ask you what is a Baseline? I have already explained this earlier, but just to provide a quick recap baseline means first approved value. So schedule baseline means &#39;The First Approved Project Schedule&#39;.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are various terms used in Earned Value Techniques. All these terms are listed on this slide. Please go through the same. They are quite self explanatory. For example, PV or Planned Value is the Estimated Value of the Work Planned to be done. This value is measured in terms of currency, say dollar. So, if planned value is $340, it was planned that $340 worth of work was to be done.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>But, how do you calculate Earned Value? It&#39;s quite simple. Just add the budget allocated to each of the activities that have completed at that point in time. The resulting value is Earned Value at point of time.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>All other parameters listed in this slide are also measured in terms of currency only.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Earned Value Formulas<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now that you have gone through the Earned Value Terms, Let&#39;s look at the formulas involved in calculating the Earned Value.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here, again, all the formulas are listed in the slide along with their explanation. Remember to note that Negative cost variance means that the project is over budget, positive means the project is under budget.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Similarly, Negative schedule variance means that project is behind schedule where as Positive schedule variance means that project is ahead of schedule.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next two parameters i.e. Cost Performance Index (CPI) and Schedule Performance Index (SPI) are also quiet important parameters. Their value varies between 0 and 1.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, if CPI is say 0.8, it means that we are getting 80 cent out of every dollar spent in the Project.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>If, SPI is say 0.9, it means that project is progressing at only 90% of the speed originally planned.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next parameter is Estimate At Completion. So, at any point of time during the project execution, if it is required to know how much the project would actually cost by the time its gets completed, just divide the Budget At Completion by the Cost Performance Index.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>What is Budget At Completion? It&#39;s simply the Budget of the Total Project.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next parameter is Estimate to Complete, which is how much more would the project cost from this point onwards. This is calculated simply by subtracting Actual Cost from the Estimate at Completion.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also, Variance at Completion can be calculated by subtracting Estimate At Completion from the Budget At Completion.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Earned Value Problem Example<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&#39;s take the example of a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/introduction-to-agile-and-scrum-part-2-rrt3co1vd3-video\">Software development Project<\/a>. The Project has four phases as shown on the slide. Each phase is budgeted to cost $10,000. Time estimate for each phase is one month. The total project duration is 4 months. The phases are sequential, i.e. they occur one after the other.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today is the end of third month; calculate the CPI and SPI of this project!<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, as you can see in the slide, at the end of the 3rd month, the status of the Project is:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First Phase, i.e. Requirement definition of the project is completed within the planned time and budget.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second phase of architecture &amp; design was planned to get over by the end of 2nd month, but it actually gets completed by 3rd month. It came up to $12,000 instead of $10,000 to get completed.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third phase, i.e., Development and Unit Testing is only 50% done, thought it was supposed to get completed by the end of the 3rd month. It came up to $9,000 instead of $5,000 to get completed.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Work on fourth phase i.e., System Testing &amp; Go live has not yet started and it was not even planned to get started.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Earned Value Problem Solution<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>To calculate the Planned Value, PV, you just need to add the amount of work that was supposed to be done by 3rd month. Three phases of the project were supposed to be completed by the end of third month. The budget to complete each of the three phases was $10,000.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>So the planned value, PV, is $10,000+$10,000+$10,000= $30,000<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>But, what is actually done by 3rd month is, two of the project phases are completed and the third phase is only 50% done, hence the Earned Value, EV is $10,000+$10,000+$5,000=$25,000<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The actual cost, AC, of doing the work is $10,000+$12,000+$9,000= $31,000<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, since we know, PV, EV and AC calculating CPI and SPI is pretty straight forward. Just put these into the formulas we learnt earlier.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Do this as an exercise!<br \/>\r\n&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<hr \/>\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 11pt; mso-ascii-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-hansi-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-bidi; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA;\"><font color=\"#000000\">We provide PMP classroom training in the following cities:<\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width: 213px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/project-management\/pmp-certification-training-sydney\/pct5co10\">SYDNEY<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width: 213px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/project-management\/pmp-certification-training-manila\/pct15766co10\">MANILA<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width: 213px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/project-management\/pmp-certification-training-muscat\/pct3551co10\">MUSCUT<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t<\/tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width: 213px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/project-management\/pmp-certification-training-singapore\/pct4623co10\">SINGAPORE<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width: 213px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/project-management\/pmp-certification-training-beijing\/pct19co10\">BEIJING<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width: 213px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/project-management\/pmp-certification-training-riyadh\/pct566co10\">RIYADH<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t<\/tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width: 213px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/project-management\/pmp-certification-training-al-khubar\/pct568co10\">AL KHUBAR<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width: 213px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/project-management\/pmp-certification-training-kuwait\/pct17243co10\">KUWAIT<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width: 213px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/project-management\/pmp-certification-training-shanghai\/pct13732co10\">SHANGHAI<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t<\/tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width: 213px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/project-management\/pmp-certification-training-dubai\/pct489co10\">DUBAI<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width: 213px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/project-management\/pmp-certification-training-prague\/pct3174co10\">PRAGUE<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width: 213px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/project-management\/pmp-certification-training-nairobi\/pct18506co10\">NAIROBI<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t<\/tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width: 213px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/project-management\/pmp-certification-training-toronto\/pct2848co10\">TORONTO<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width: 213px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/project-management\/pmp-certification-training-bangalore\/pct47co10\">BANGALORE<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width: 213px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/project-management\/pmp-certification-training-houston\/pct2140co10\">HOUSTON<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t<\/tr>\r\n\t<\/tbody>\r\n<\/table>","h1Tag":null,"url":"resources\/project-management-articles\/earned-value-technique-rar118","status":"1","image_url":"http:\/\/cfs22.simplicdn.net\/ice9\/free_resources_article_thumb\/freeresources_PMP-Earned_Value_Technique_5197700489f8f.jpg","created_at":"2012-01-25T00:00:00+00:00","updated_at":null,"infographic_url":null,"thumbnail_url":"NULL","shares":0,"likes":0,"comments":0,"engagement_score":0,"segments":[],"skills":[],"tags":[],"id":"56dfb0f1ac530efd098b45c5"},{"course_id":[],"type":"article","label_id":"2","vertical":null,"name":"ITIL-Service Management \u2013 An Unsurpassed Management Practice","display_name":"ITIL-Service Management \u2013 An Unsurpassed Management Practice","author_name":null,"author_description":null,"author_image":null,"author_linkedin_profile":null,"author_twitter_profile":null,"short_description":null,"article_content":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">With the increasing need for IT service management, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/it-service-management\/itil-expert-certification-training\" title=\"ITIL V3 Expert\">ITIL V3 Expert<\/a> has now become one of the most sought after IT credential. Get an overview of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/it-service-management\/itsm-certification-training\" title=\"ITIL service management\">ITIL service management<\/a> in this video.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nLet&#39;s now understand Service and the way a Service is looked at, both from a customer perspective as well as from that of a Service Provider.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAll human activity is directed towards achieving desirable results, so as to finally create or add value to various aspects of life or Business. These results are achieved by performing some tasks and are subject to constraints.<br \/>\r\n&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/LV7fTC0NJV0\" width=\"420\"><\/iframe><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Broadly speaking, services facilitate outcomes by enhancing the performance of the tasks and by managing constraints. The result is an increase in the possibility of desired outcomes.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nFor example, we all want to have a healthy body and mind which is the desired results. This outcome is dependent on a lot of activities one has to do, e.g., eat healthy, exercise, take proper rest etc. and this is subject to a lot of constraints, e.g. Availability of healthy food, etc.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThis desired outcome can be facilitated by other parties for example, doctors. The doctors will evaluate your current condition and recommend change in activities. For example, the doctor can advise you to eat less butter, use refined oil etc. or help one manage the constraints. Conducting a bypass surgery if required is an example of managing constraint.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nOther common examples of services are postal services so that you don&#39;t have to travel or worry about travelling across seven seas to deliver a letter.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nComing back to a Business example:<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nLet&#39;s say an online bookstore is looking for a place to store all the data related to its online book selling business for example books details, customer details, etc., or what in IT is known as database or storage solutions.<br \/>\r\nNow linking it to our description of Services, the desired outcome is online selling of books; one of the activities facilitating the outcome is storage of data. Now the bookstore is not specialized in managing storage as an IT service and therefore does not want to manage the associated costs and risks which could come from Infrastructure, staff, facilities Etc.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nHowever, there are organizations in the market that are willing to do that for a cost, commonly called Service Providers, say for example Oracle Corporation, who have specialized knowledge and experience in large scale database systems, and the confidence to control the associated costs and risks. The bookstore agrees to pay for the database service provided by the service provider under specific terms and conditions.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nSo to get back to the definition, the <strong>service provider<\/strong>, ie Oracle Corporation, provides value to the <strong>customer<\/strong>, ie the online bookstore, by <strong>facilitating<\/strong>, in other words, managing book selling company&#39;s database and its associated costs and risks, the business outcomes of which is selling books online.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nJust to clarify it further, in this case, Online Book Selling Company is the customer and Oracle Corporation is the Service Provider. Oracle Corporation is providing <strong>&quot;database storage&quot; &quot;service&quot;<\/strong> to the online book selling company.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nSo I hope by now you understand what is a service, let&#39;s now understand the concept called service management.<br \/>\r\n&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>What is a Service Management?<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Let me begin by a quote from Peter Drucker, a renowned American management guru.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<strong>&#39;Quality in a product or service is not what the supplier puts in. It is what the customer gets out and is willing to pay for.&#39;<\/strong><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nSome time back, we defined Service Management as an effective, efficient and process driven management of transforming IT resources into valuable IT services.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<em>Let me explain this further by means of a diagram<\/em><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAs you can see in this diagram, it emphasizes the link that has to be preserved between the desired business outcomes and the services that Service Management is responsible for.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nSo what do we mean by Capabilities, resources and other terms used in the graphic?<\/p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>Capabilities are<\/strong> the functions and processes used to manage services. Capabilities are <strong>intangible<\/strong> assets of an organization and cannot be purchased but have to be developed and matured over time.<\/li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Resources<\/strong> is a generic term that includes IT infrastructure, people, money or anything else that might help to deliver an IT service. Resources are the <strong>tangible<\/strong> assets of the organization.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nResources and capability put together constitute the Service Assets. For example, Email as a Service.<br \/>\r\nThe organization, say Google, providing this service needs to have some hardware: servers, routers, switches, etc. to relay emails and Software like GMail to let users read their emails. These are example of assets.<br \/>\r\nThey also need a capable team to manage these assets and the money required to procure these assets.<br \/>\r\nBut if Google&#39;s customers don&#39;t know how to get this email service, all of these assets are wasted. So how to get an email account, how to maintain it, Where to go for support if any issues occur are some of the critical underlying elements of delivering email service. These methods are called processes. We will touch them in a little while.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nBut before that, let me explain two more terms, Performance and Value.\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Performance is a measure of what is achieved or delivered by a system, person, team, process, or IT service.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nFrom our email as a service example, effective use by all users, Number of mails delivered to the intended recipients, etc are some of performance measure of email service.<br \/>\r\nAnd\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Value is a measure of the Return on Investments or benefits to the business.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<p>So going back to our example of Email as a Service. In older days, messaging used to happen through paper memos. If somebody had to convey a message, they would get it typewritten on a piece of paper and then a courier service would deliver it to the recipient. At some point in time, organizations realized the constraints this method of message delivery had on the organisational capability to deliver to its customers. Luckily for them somebody realized the constraints and invented email, which has since then revolutionized the messaging capabilities of the organizations&#39;.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe results of using this service allowed businesses and organizations to spread across geographies. It has contributed to faster decision making and execution due to speedier flow of information. And ultimately contributes to greater revenues and profits for the business or the organisation. Or in other words it has enhanced the <strong>Business outcomes.<\/strong><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nTo learn more visit our <a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/it-service-management\/itil-intermediate-so-training\">ITIL service operation course <\/a>page.<br \/>\r\n&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<hr \/>\r\n<p>We provide <a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/it-service-management\/malc-certification-training\" title=\"ITIL Managing across the Lifecycle (MALC) training\">ITIL Managing across the Lifecycle (MALC) training<\/a> in the following cities:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"1\" style=\"width: 150px;\">\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/it-service-management\/malc-certification-training-bangalore\/pct47co30\">BANGALORE<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t<\/tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/it-service-management\/malc-certification-training-mumbai\/pct45co30\">MUMBAI<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t<\/tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/it-service-management\/malc-certification-training-pune\/pct55co30\">PUNE<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t<\/tr>\r\n\t<\/tbody>\r\n<\/table>\r\n","h1Tag":null,"url":"resources\/it-service-management-articles\/itil-service-management-rar120","status":null,"image_url":"http:\/\/cfs22.simplicdn.net\/ice9\/free_resources_article_thumb\/freeresources_ITIL-Service_Management_5197704115762.jpg","created_at":"2016-03-09T05:13:21+00:00","updated_at":null,"infographic_url":null,"thumbnail_url":"NULL","shares":0,"likes":0,"comments":0,"engagement_score":0,"segments":[],"skills":[],"tags":[],"id":"56dfb0f1ac530efd098b45c7"},{"course_id":[],"type":"article","label_id":"2","vertical":null,"name":"ITIL Problem Workaround \u2013 A Leader\u2019s Guide to Manage Problems","display_name":"ITIL Problem Workaround \u2013 A Leader\u2019s Guide to Manage Problems","author_name":null,"author_description":null,"author_image":null,"author_linkedin_profile":null,"author_twitter_profile":null,"short_description":null,"article_content":"<p><br \/>\r\nAn introduction to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/it-service-management\/itil-foundation-training\">ITIL V3 Foundation Certification<\/a> and ITIL Problems workaround as demonstrated in this video.<br \/>\r\nWe begin the key terms definition and understanding with events, alerts and incidents.<br \/>\r\nEvent is defined as an expected or unexpected change of state of an IT component that could or is negatively impacting delivery of IT services.<br \/>\r\nEvents are typically notifications created by an IT service, Configuration Item (CI) or a monitoring tool.<br \/>\r\nTo establish importance, Events may be classified as:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Events that indicate a normal operation, otherwise known <strong>as Informational event types<\/strong> - For example a user logging on to use an application.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Events that indicate an abnormal operation, otherwise known as <strong>exceptional event types<\/strong> - For example a user who is trying to log on to an application with an incorrect password or a PC scan that reveals the installation of unauthorized software.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Events that signal an unusual but not exceptional operation, otherwise known as <strong>Warning event types<\/strong> - It may provide an indication that the situation requires a little more supervision. For example utilization of a server&#39;s memory reaches within five per cent of its highest acceptable level.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nBut what is an Alert and an Incident and what the relationship between the three?<br \/>\r\nWe understand this in the next slide.\r\n<h3><strong>Alerts &amp; Incidents<\/strong><\/h3>\r\nAn <strong>alert<\/strong> is a warning that a threshold has been reached, something has changed, or a Failure has occurred.<br \/>\r\nAlerts are often created and managed by System Management tools and managed by the Event Management Process.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe Objective is to notify the concerned Stakeholders so that an action could be taken to correct the situation.<br \/>\r\nAn <strong>Incident<\/strong>, on the other hand, refers to an unplanned interruption to an IT service or a reduction in the quality of an IT service.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nIt could be a failure of an IT component that has not yet affected service, but could likely disrupt service if left unchecked. This can be raised by IT support teams. For Example: Failure of a server in a clustered mode.<br \/>\r\nSo how are Event, alert and Incident related?<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAlerts and Incidents are all events but not all events are alerts and much less incidents.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nWe will understand how these are handled in the respective processes, namely event management and Incident Management.\r\n<h3><strong>Service Request<\/strong><\/h3>\r\nThis brings us to another key term in service operations, Service request.<br \/>\r\nA service request is a generic description for many varying types of demands that are placed upon the IT Department by the users. Many of these requests are actually small changes - low risk, frequently occurring, low cost, etcetera.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nTheir scale and frequency, low-risk nature means that they are better handled by a separate process, rather than being allowed to congest and obstruct the normal Incident and Change Management processes and so are typically handled in the request fulfillment process.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nSome common Examples are:\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>A request to change a password or unlock accounts.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>A request to install an approved software application onto a particular PC,<\/li>\r\n\t<li>A request to relocate desktop equipment<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<p>So what happens when we have one or more incidents to resolve but have not found an underlying cause?<br \/>\r\nThat means we have a problem! Let us understand this key term in our next slides.<br \/>\r\n&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Problem &amp; Workaround<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In the context of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/itil-lifecycle-components-rar122-article\">ITIL<\/a>, a <strong>problem<\/strong> is defined as a cause of one or more incidents, whose cause is usually not known at that time.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAnd the process for managing problems is called problem management. Problems will be typically classified and prioritized as incidents.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAnd what&#39;s a workaround?<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nA workaround is a temporary way to restore service failures to a usable level. For example; rebooting a server hang, so we don&#39;t know why the server failed, but if we reboot the server, the service will be up.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe workarounds are used for reducing or eliminating the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/itil-incident-problem-management-part-2-article\">Impact of an Incident or Problem <\/a>for which a full Resolution is not yet available.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nWorkarounds could be found while trying to resolve incidents or problems. Workarounds for Incidents that do not have associated Problem Records are documented in the Incident Record and Workarounds for Problems are documented in Known Error Records.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nJust in case you are wondering what are incident or problem records? Incident or problem records are records of incidents or problems created in the service management tool.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nSo are all problems to be solved? Can they be solved? Like we said earlier, problems have similar or same prioritization as incidents, so for low priority problems, a call may be taken on whether or not to make efforts at finding solutions when a workaround will suffice. Using our server reboot example, if the root cause is found to be a faulty motherboard and the server is a low criticality server and a server reboot takes care of the issue for a month, the organization can decide to live with it.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAlso it may not be possible to resolve an issue without hardware or a software upgrade, so once again we will be required to live with a workaround or plan for alternatives, if it is business critical.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAnd what is a known error; let&#39;s understand that in the next slide.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<hr \/>We provide training programs for ITIL Foundation in the following cities:\r\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width: 213px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/it-service-management\/itil-foundation-training-los-angeles\/pct2151co18\">LOS ANGELES<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width: 213px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/it-service-management\/itil-foundation-training-hartford\/pct2161co18\">HARTFORD<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width: 213px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/it-service-management\/itil-foundation-training-thiruvananthapuram\/pct13807co18\">THIRUVANANTHAPURAM<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t<\/tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width: 213px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/it-service-management\/itil-foundation-training-miami\/pct2130co18\">MIAMI<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width: 213px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/it-service-management\/itil-foundation-training-baton-rouge\/pct3179co18\">BATON ROUGE<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width: 213px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/it-service-management\/itil-foundation-training-phoenix\/pct2193co18\">PHOENIX<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t<\/tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width: 213px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/it-service-management\/itil-foundation-training-orlando\/pct2833co18\">ORLANDO<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width: 213px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/it-service-management\/itil-foundation-training-tampa\/pct2199co18\">TAMPA<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width: 213px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/it-service-management\/itil-foundation-training-pune\/pct55co18\">PUNE<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t<\/tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width: 213px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/it-service-management\/itil-foundation-training-fort-lauderdale\/pct3053co18\">FORT LAUDERDALE<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width: 213px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/it-service-management\/itil-foundation-training-san-jose\/pct2157co18\">SAN JOSE<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width: 213px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/it-service-management\/itil-foundation-training-sydney\/pct5co18\">SYDNEY<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t<\/tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width: 213px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/it-service-management\/itil-foundation-training-atlanta\/pct2138co18\">ATLANTA<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width: 213px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/it-service-management\/itil-foundation-training-singapore\/pct4623co18\">SINGAPORE<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width: 213px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/it-service-management\/itil-foundation-training-albany\/pct2805co18\">ALBANY<\/a><\/td>\r\n\t\t<\/tr>\r\n\t<\/tbody>\r\n<\/table>\r\n","h1Tag":null,"url":"resources\/it-service-management-articles\/itil-problems-workaround-rar121","status":"1","image_url":"http:\/\/cfs22.simplicdn.net\/ice9\/free_resources_article_thumb\/freeresources_ITIL-Problems_Workaround_5197705d129af.jpg","created_at":"2012-03-11T00:00:00+00:00","updated_at":null,"infographic_url":null,"thumbnail_url":"NULL","shares":0,"likes":0,"comments":0,"engagement_score":0,"segments":[],"skills":[],"tags":[],"id":"56dfb0f1ac530efd098b45c8"}],"limit":"100","offset":0}
